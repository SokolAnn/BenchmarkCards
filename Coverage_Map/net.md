# Benchmark–Risk Coverage Map

![Benchmark–Risk Coverage Map](/Coverage_Map/net.png)

This visualization shows how different **LLM benchmarks** are connected to various **AI risks** and **sub-risks**. Each node in the network represents either a benchmark, a risk, or a more detailed sub-risk.

## How to Read the Map

- **Node Shapes**  
  - ● Circle: Benchmark  
  - ■ Square: Risk  
  - ◆ Diamond: Sub-risk

- **Node Colors**  
  - Black: Benchmark  
  - Red: Risk  
  - Orange: Sub-risk

- **Node Size**  
  - The bigger the node, the more connections it has or the more important it is.

## What Does This Show?

- **Connections:**  
  Lines connect benchmarks to the risks or sub-risks they target (for example, “hallucination,” “robustness,” or “legal compliance”).

- **Zoomed Section:**  
  The upper-left zoom highlights the “robustness” cluster, showing which benchmarks are focused on risks like “hallucination,” “prompt injection,” and “data poisoning.”

- **Coverage Gaps:**  
  Some risks (such as “data laws and privacy” or “societal impact”) have fewer benchmarks connected, highlighting areas where more evaluation tools are needed.

## Why Is This Useful?

- **Find Benchmarks:**  
  Quickly see which benchmarks evaluate certain risks or safety issues.

- **Analyze Coverage:**  
  Identify risks that are well-covered versus under-covered by current benchmarks.

- **Explore Relationships:**  
  Easily spot related benchmarks and understand their main focus.
