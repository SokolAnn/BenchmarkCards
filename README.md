# BenchmarkCards: Large Language Model and Risk Reporting 

BenchmarkCards offer a standardized way to document LLM benchmarks clearly and transparently. Inspired by Model Cards and Datasheets, BenchmarkCards help researchers and practitioners understand exactly what benchmarks test, how they relate to real-world risks, and how to interpret their results responsibly.

Who is this for? AI researchers, data scientists, auditors, policymakers, and anyone concerned with responsible AI deployment.

## 🛠️ How to Use this Repository

### 🔗 Key Contents

- 📋 **BenchmarkCard_Template.md**: A handy template for creating your very own BenchmarkCard for LLM documentation. 

- ⚖️ **ComparisonBenchmarks.md**: Curious about different benchmarks? This document provides examples of benchmarks used for evaluating risks in LLMs. It doesn’t compare them directly but instead illustrates diverse benchmarks to help you understand their various purposes and contexts of use. 
- 🗂 **Benchmarks_and_Risk_Table.md**: A detailed table with benchmarks found in literature, including key references.
- 🌐 **Benchmark_Network.md**:  A visual network that shows how benchmarks connect and relate, especially when it comes to evaluating LLM risks.
