# 📊 BenchmarkCards: Large Language Model and Risk Reporting 📊

Welcome to the **BenchmarkCards** repository! This is where we introduce a structured framework for documenting benchmarks used in large language models (LLMs). Our goal? To make benchmarking LLMs easier, transparent, and more informative by focusing on risks and key metrics.  🚀

## 🛠️ How to Use this Repository

### 🔗 Key Contents

- **BenchmarkCard_Template.md**: 📋 A handy template for creating your very own BenchmarkCard for LLM documentation. 
- **ComparisonBenchmarks.md**: ⚖️ Curious about different benchmarks? This document provides examples of benchmarks used for evaluating risks in LLMs. It doesn’t compare them directly but instead illustrates diverse benchmarks to help you understand their various purposes and contexts of use. 
- **Benchmarks_and_Risk_Table.md**: 🗂 A detailed table with benchmarks found in literature, including key references.
- **Benchmark_Network.md**: 🌐 A visual network that shows how benchmarks connect and relate, especially when it comes to evaluating LLM risks.
