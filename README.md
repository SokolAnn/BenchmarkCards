# BenchmarkCards: Large Language Model and Risk Reporting 📊

This repository contains the paper titled **"BenchmarkCards: Large Language Model and Risk Reporting"** submitted for review. The paper proposes a structured framework to standardize the documentation of benchmarks for large language models (LLMs), focusing on capturing important benchmark properties and risks, and promoting transparency in evaluation.

## Abstract 📄

Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities but also introduce significant risks. One way to mitigate these risks is through comprehensive pre-deployment evaluations using benchmarks designed to test for specific vulnerabilities. However, the rapidly expanding body of LLM benchmark literature lacks a standardized method for documenting crucial benchmark details, hindering consistent use and informed selection.

**BenchmarkCards** addresses this gap by providing a structured framework specifically for documenting LLM benchmark properties—including datasets, intended metrics, and pre-/post-processing—rather than defining the entire evaluation process itself. 

BenchmarkCards do not prescribe how to measure or interpret benchmark results (e.g., defining “correctness”), but instead offer a standardized way to capture and report key characteristics like targeted risks and evaluation methodologies. This structured metadata facilitates informed benchmark selection, enabling researchers to choose appropriate benchmarks for their needs and promoting transparency and reproducibility in LLM evaluation.
