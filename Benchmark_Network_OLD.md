The network image shows 130 benchmarks and their connections to various LLM risks and sub-risks.
The network highlights key research areas, like fairness, which has many benchmarks, while some risks are underrepresented. It also shows how some benchmarks address multiple risks, demonstrating their broader relevance.
The network's complexity arises from how benchmarks and risks are interconnected, with dense areas showing concentrated research activity.![network_becnhmarks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d96ae14e-6375-4c0f-ab6b-fbbb47ab7a8d)
