      "Precision",
      "Recall",
      "F1-score (macro F1)",
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Standard classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy) computed on the pre-partitioned test sets provided by the original corpora. F1 reported is macro F1. Class probabilities from SRC are normalized with softmax and label assigned by maximum probability. Models trained with tuned learning rates (values searched: 2e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5); other training parameters used default values from the pretrained models.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy and F1 indicate better relation classification. SRC generally achieves higher classification accuracy than MRC, while MRC demonstrates more consistent (robust) performance on smaller or sparser-annotation corpora. Domain-specific pre-training (SciBERT) and uncased variants tend to yield better and more stable performance on scholarly data.",
    "baseline_results": "Table 2 reports per-model Accuracy and macro-F1 across three corpora. Example aggregated result: SciBERT uncased averaged Accuracy 82.91 (±2.04) and averaged F1 78.99 (±1.54) across corpora. Detailed per-corpus and per-model numbers are provided in Table 2 of the paper.",
    "validation": "Used original train/dev/test splits from the source corpora (SemEval18: 350 training / 150 testing; SciERC: 350/50/100 train/dev/test). Models were evaluated on the provided test splits; learning rate was tuned over specified values; other training parameters used defaults from BERT/SciBERT."
