    "name": "KnowGIC (Knowledge Graph Implication Chains)",
    "abbreviation": "KnowGIC",
    "overview": "KnowGIC is a benchmark dataset developed to evaluate model-editing techniques under the deep editing setting. It consists of multi-step reasoning paths designed to assess the extent to which original facts remain deducible after editing, while testing the indirect knowledge leakage and ripple effects caused by the edits.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "The primary objective of the KnowGIC benchmark is to provide a systematic evaluation of model-editing techniques in LLMs, focusing on understanding how edits affect knowledge retention and inferential understanding post-edit.",

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manually reviewed and pruned by human experts to remove inaccuracies and irrelevant triplets."

    "metrics": [
      "Indirect Fact Recovery (IFR)",
      "Preservation"
    ],
    "calculation": "IFR is calculated to measure the deducibility of original facts through reasoning paths after editing, while Preservation assesses retention of related factual knowledge.",
    "interpretation": "A high IFR indicates significant original fact deducibility, suggesting incomplete deep editing, whereas a high Preservation score indicates successful retention of broader contextual integrity.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "Data was manually validated and refined through human oversight, focusing on high accuracy and completeness of extracted knowledge."
