    "name": "ArPanEmo: An Open -Source Dataset for Fine -Grained Emotion Recognition in Arabic Online Content during COVID -19 Pandemic",
    "abbreviation": "ArPanEmo",
    "overview": "Presents the ArPanEmo dataset, a novel dataset for fine-grained emotion recognition of online posts in Arabic. The dataset comprises 11,128 online posts manually labeled for ten emotion categories or neutral, focuses on the Saudi dialect and topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was collected from Twitter, YouTube, and online newspaper comments between March 2020 and March 2022. The final dataset is formatted as CSV with three columns: post identifier, post text, and emotion label.",

    "annotation": "Semi-automatic pipeline: lexicon-based filtering using the Arabic NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon to preselect emotion-related posts, followed by manual annotation.

    "interpretation": "Fleiss' kappa κ = 0.7123 interpreted per Landis and Koch as 'substantial agreement'. The BERT-based model achieved the best performance among tested models with a weighted-average F1-score of 0.67; comparable macro- and weighted-average metrics indicate a relatively balanced class distribution.",

    "validation": "Inter-annotator agreement measured using Fleiss' kappa (κ = 0.7123). Dataset split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets with stratification per domain (healthcare and Impacted Life Aspects) and per emotion category to balance distributions. Dataset validity further assessed by training and evaluating SVM, BiGRU, and BERT-based models."
