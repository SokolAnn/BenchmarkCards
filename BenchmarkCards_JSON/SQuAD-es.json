    "overview": "We develop the Translate-Align-Retrieve (TAR) method to automatically translate the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v1.1 to Spanish, producing SQuAD-es v1.1 as a large-scale Spanish QA training resource and using it to train Spanish QA systems.",

    "goal": "Automatically translate the SQuAD v1.1 training dataset to Spanish using the TAR method and provide SQuAD-es v1.1 as a large-scale Spanish training resource for question answering.",

      "Question Answering",
      "Machine Reading Comprehension (Extractive)"
    ],
    "limitations": "Noise introduced by the NMT and alignment components that produces misaligned or overlapping answer spans; SQuAD-es v1.1 is larger but noisier while SQuAD-es-small is smaller but more accurate.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Automatically translated from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v1.1 using the Translate-Align-Retrieve (TAR) method; NMT training data collected from WikiMatrix and OPUS resources (Wikipedia, TED-2013, News-Commentary, Tatoeba, OpenSubTitles).",
    "size": "SQuAD-es v1.1: 87,595 examples (out of 87,599 original); SQuAD-es-small v1.1: 46,260 examples (â‰ˆ53% of original).",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Automatically generated via machine translation (NMT) and unsupervised word alignment with post-processing heuristics (Translate-Align-Retrieve); no manual re-annotation reported for the full dataset (manual error analysis performed on sampled articles)."

    "interpretation": "Higher F1 and Exact Match indicate better QA performance; models trained on SQuAD-es v1.1 achieved state-of-the-art results on Spanish portions of MLQA and XQuAD, and a larger but noisier SQuAD-es v1.1 improved performance compared to a smaller, cleaner SQuAD-es-small.",
