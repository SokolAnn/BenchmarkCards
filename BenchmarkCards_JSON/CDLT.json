    "name": "Concept Drift and Long-Tailed Distribution (CDLT)",
    "abbreviation": "CDLT",
    "overview": "A novel fine-grained visual categorization dataset that focuses on concept drift and long-tailed distribution in real-world scenarios. The dataset is collected by gathering 11,195 images of succulent plant instances across 258 subclasses over 47 consecutive months in natural contexts, with season information recorded as auxiliary data. The dataset is intended to facilitate research on concept drift and long-tailed recognition and to benchmark algorithms under these challenges.",

    "calculation": "Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies computed on provided train/test splits (6:4 split selected empirically). MMD computed per subclass between training and test sets with 100 independent permutations to obtain 95% confidence interval.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Top-1/Top-5 accuracy indicates better classification performance. MMD values above the 95% confidence bound indicate a 'significant' distributional change (concept drift). Training on single-season data significantly impairs generalization compared to training on all-season data. The authors report a performance gap of about 5% when drifted data is ignored in training for many models.",
    "baseline_results": "Selected results on CDLT: B-CNN (ResNet-50) 72.79% (Top-1), HBP (ResNet-50) 75.64%, NTS-Net (ResNet-50) 78.20%, MCL (ResNet-50) 75.42%, MOMN (ResNet-50) 69.76%, OURS (ResNet-50) 78.82%; ViT (ViT-B-16) 77.81%, OURS (ViT-B-16) 79.20%. CLIP on CDLT: Pre-trained baseline 3.03%, CLIP(B) 2.02%, CLIP(L) 2.32%.",
    "validation": "Experiments repeated three times independently and averaged. Random-label experiment: when training labels are randomized, Top-1/Top-5 accuracies drop to 0.53% and 2.18%, validating label meaningfulness. MMD analysis uses 100 permutations to compute 95% confidence bounds for significance testing."
