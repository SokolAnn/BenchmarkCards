    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "EvoCodeBench is designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, addressing limitations such as data leakage and lack of domain-specific evaluations. It includes evolving data updated regularly and domain-specific evaluations to help practitioners select superior LLMs.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Pass@k is calculated based on the number of correct programs out of generated programs that pass test cases; Recall@k measures the recall of reference dependencies in generated programs.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Pass@k and Recall@k scores indicate better performance in generating accurate solutions.",
    "baseline_results": "For example, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-4 on EvoCodeBench-2403 is 20.74%.",
    "validation": "The benchmarks' integrity and performance were validated through extensive experiments with various LLMs."
