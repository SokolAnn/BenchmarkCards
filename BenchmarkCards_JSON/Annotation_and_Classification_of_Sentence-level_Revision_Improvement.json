    "name": "Annotation and Classification of Sentence-level Revision Improvement",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "Introduces a corpus of between-draft revisions of student argumentative essays annotated as to whether each revision improves essay quality (binary labels: Better / NotBetter). Demonstrates usage by developing a machine learning model to predict revision improvement and explores augmenting training data with expert edits from the AESW corpus, showing that blending expert and non-expert revisions can improve prediction performance.",

    "limitations": "Corpus size is small (940 ArgRewrite modification revisions). Annotation shows low inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss's kappa = 0.201 for all 940; 0.263 for majority â‰¥5). Annotation does not consider sentence context in paragraph. Class imbalance (784 Better vs 156 NotBetter). Performance on identifying NotBetter revisions remains low for some models.",
