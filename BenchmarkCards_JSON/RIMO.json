    "name": "RIMO (Remade International Mathematical Olympiad)",
    "abbreviation": "RIMO",
    "overview": "RIMO is a two-track benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning by reformulating International Mathematical Olympiad problems into a deterministic format. It consists of RIMO-N, with 335 problems that allow for exact answer checking, and RIMO-P, featuring 456 proof problems with guided sub-problems for step-by-step reasoning evaluation.",
