    "calculation": "Correctness is the percentage of test cases passed; efficiency is evaluated under strict runtime thresholds; quality is assessed using static analysis through CodeScene.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate better performance in correctness, efficiency, and code quality.",
    "baseline_results": "Human performance data from 393,150 submissions shows average scores across all tasks.",
    "validation": "Validation included correlation analyses and PCA to confirm distinct contributions from each performance dimension."
