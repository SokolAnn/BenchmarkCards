    "abbreviation": "ClassEval-T",
    "overview": "ClassEval-T is a class-level code translation benchmark designed to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs) on translating complex class structures in code across multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. It provides a more accurate evaluation of LLM capabilities in real-world software development tasks compared to previous benchmarks focused on statement or method-level translations.",
