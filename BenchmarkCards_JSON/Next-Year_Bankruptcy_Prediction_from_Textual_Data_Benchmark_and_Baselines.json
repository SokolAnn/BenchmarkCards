  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Baseline models: Binary Bag-of-Words (logistic regression), TF-IDF + logistic regression, Word2Vec mean embedding + feed-forward neural network, Longformer encoder + feed-forward classifier",

      "Temporal out-of-period train/validation/test splits (training data up to 2015/2017; validation on 2017 and 2018; test on 2019 and 2020)",
      "Undersampling of majority class for training (to 90%-10% distribution)",
      "Hyperparameter optimization (grid search for classical models; Tree-Structured Parzen Estimation via Optuna for neural models)"

    "metrics": [
      "Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC)",
      "Recall@100",
      "Average Precision (AP)",
      "Cumulative Accuracy Profile Ratio (CAP)",
      "Cumulative Decile Rank"
    ],
    "calculation": "AUC: area under the ROC aggregating true positive vs false positive rates across thresholds. Recall@100: proportion of positive cases (bankrupt firms) present in the 100 highest ranked samples. AP: weighted mean of precision at each threshold with increase in recall as weight. CAP: summarizes the CAP curve (cumulative positives vs percentage of ranked data). Cumulative Decile Rank: cumulative proportion of positives in each decile when ranking by classifier score.",
    "interpretation": "AUC quantifies overall binary prediction performance. Recall-oriented metrics (Recall@100, CAP, cumulative decile rank) emphasize the model's ability to detect distressed firms within a fixed investigation budget. AP reports precision-oriented performance across thresholds. The authors prioritize AUC for model selection but consider recall-oriented metrics important for practical use.",
    "baseline_results": "Selected AUC results on test sets 2019 (2020) from Table 3 — Single-year history AUCs: Binary 0.79 (0.84), TF-IDF 0.80 (0.85), W2V 0.88 (0.90), Longformer 0.78 (0.79). Three-year history AUCs: Binary 0.90 (0.92), TF-IDF 0.92 (0.96), W2V 0.95 (0.95), Longformer 0.85 (0.84).",
    "validation": "Two validation sets (2017 and 2018) are used for hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameters are tuned to maximize the weighted AUC on the 2017 and 2018 validation data. Final models are trained on data up to 2017 and evaluated on test sets 2019 and 2020. Training uses undersampling of majority class and Optuna/TPE for neural model hyperparameter search."
