    "name": "HALLUCINOGEN",
    "overview": "HALLUCINOGEN is a novel visual question answering (VQA) benchmark that employs contextual reasoning prompts as hallucination attacks to evaluate the extent of hallucination in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It provides a comprehensive study of the implicit reasoning capabilities of LVLMs by categorizing visual entities into salient and latent entities and designing various hallucination attacks.",
