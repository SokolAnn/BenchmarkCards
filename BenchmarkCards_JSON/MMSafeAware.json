    "abbreviation": "MMSafeAware",
    "overview": "MMSafeAware is a comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across 29 safety scenarios with 1,500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. It includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess the models' abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity.",
