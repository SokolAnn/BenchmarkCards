    "name": "InfoSearch",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "InfoSearch is a novel retrieval evaluation benchmark spanning six document-level attributes: Audience, Keyword, Format, Language, Length, and Source. It introduces novel metrics – Strict Instruction Compliance Ratio (SICR) and Weighted Instruction Sensitivity Evaluation (WISE) – to accurately assess the models’ responsiveness to instructions.",

    "methods": [
      "Evaluation on various retrieval models using instructed, reverse-instructed, and original modes."

    "metrics": [
      "Strict Instruction Compliance Ratio (SICR)",
      "Weighted Instruction Sensitivity Evaluation (WISE)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the model's responsiveness to both positive and negative instructions as detailed in the methodology section.",
    "interpretation": "Higher SICR and WISE scores indicate better adherence to instructions; a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-following capabilities.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Models were evaluated across multiple dimensions and modes to capture their instruction-following capabilities."
