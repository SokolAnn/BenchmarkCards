    "name": "GraLMatch: Matching Groups of Entities with Graphs and Language Models",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper introduces two new multi-source benchmark datasets for entity group matching, aimed at matching records originating from multiple data sources but representing the same real-world entities. It focuses on the concept of transitively matched records and proposes a novel methodology called GraLMatch to address the challenges in entity group matching.",
