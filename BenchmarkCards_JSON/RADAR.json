    "calculation": "Exact match is calculated based on the ability of the models to correctly respond to queries over perturbed tabular data.",
    "interpretation": "Higher exact match scores indicate better performance in recognizing and reasoning about data artifacts.",
    "baseline_results": "Performance varies by model; frontier models show significant performance drops on perturbed data compared to clean data.",
    "validation": "Evaluated using a series of perturbations that simulate real-world data artifacts and by measuring performance across varying table sizes."
