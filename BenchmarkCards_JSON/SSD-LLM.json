    "name": "Subpopulation Structure Discovery with Large Language Model (SSD-LLM)",
    "abbreviation": "SSD-LLM",
    "overview": "We introduce a novel concept of subpopulation structures to represent, analyze, and utilize subpopulation distributions within datasets. The SSD-LLM framework employs large language models to analyze informative image captions and summarize the structures, facilitating tasks such as dataset subpopulation organization, subpopulation shift, and slice discovery.",
