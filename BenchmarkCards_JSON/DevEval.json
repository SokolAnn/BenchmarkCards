    ],
    "calculation": "Pass@k is calculated based on the number of programs that pass predefined test cases out of the total generated programs.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Pass@k and Recall@k values indicate better coding performance of the model.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Evaluated against 8 popular LLMs to determine performance in real-world coding scenarios."
