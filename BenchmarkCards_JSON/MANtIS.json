Default time-based split: 70% oldest training, 15% development, 15% test. Ranking results averaged over 5 runs. User intent prediction: multi-label classification on manually labeled subset; evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation, reporting averages of Precision, Micro F1, Macro F1.",
    "interpretation": "Authors report that fine-tuned BERT is the best performing model for both tasks. For conversation response ranking, models perform well with 10 candidate replies but degrade severely with 50 candidates, indicating challenges in realistic large-scale settings. For intent prediction, BERT substantially outperforms other baselines.",
