      "F1 Score",
      "ROUGE-L"
    ],
    "calculation": "F1 Score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall based on the predicted answer comparing the sets of words in the predicted and actual answers. ROUGE-L measures the recall of the generated response related to the gold response.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 scores indicate better overall quality and correctness of generated answers. ROUGE-L evaluates how closely the generated text matches a reference answer.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "The benchmark was validated through extensive evaluation on multiple language models."
