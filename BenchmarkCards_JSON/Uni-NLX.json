    "overview": "Uni-NLX is a unified framework that consolidates all Natural Language Explanations (NLE) tasks into a single and compact multi-task model using a unified training objective of text generation. It introduces two new NLE datasets: ImageNetX for explaining ImageNet categories and VQA-ParaX for explaining the Visual Question Answering task.",
