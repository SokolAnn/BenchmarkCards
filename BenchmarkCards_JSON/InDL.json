    "overview": "This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating deep learning modelsâ€™ capacity for in-diagram logic interpretation. Leveraging the realm of visual illusions, the authors establish a dataset, InDL, designed to rigorously test and benchmark models on their handling of visual illusions and in-diagram logical reasoning, providing a quantifiable measure to rank models.",

  "data": {
    "source": "The InDL dataset is composed of images derived from classic geometric optical/visual illusions (Hering, Wundt, Muller-Lyer, Poggendorff, Vertical-horizontal, Zollner), organized into five dataset groups as summarized in Table 1 (Hering & Wundt combined as one dataset plus Muller-Lyer, Poggendorff, Vertical-horizontal, Zollner).",

    "calculation": "Recall = TruePositive / (TruePositive + FalseNegative). A true positive is an instance where both the model and the ground truth agree that the sample contains a specific in-diagram logic; a false negative is where the model fails to recognize the in-diagram logic but the ground truth indicates it is present.",
    "interpretation": "High recall indicates a model is effective at detecting the presence of in-diagram logic; low recall suggests the model fails to recognize in-diagram logic (i.e., misses positives).",

    "validation": "Models were trained until no improvement in validation loss over a certain number of epochs and then evaluated on a separate test set."
