    "overview": "This paper presents a dataset consisting of 540 structured grammar generation challenges to evaluate the grammar inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using few-shot learning. It introduces the HyGenar algorithm, a hybrid genetic algorithm to optimize grammar generation, significantly improving performance across various LLMs.",
