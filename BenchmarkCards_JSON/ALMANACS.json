    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the predicted probabilities of model decisions versus ground truth.",
    "interpretation": "Lower values on KLD IV indicate better simulatability.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline evaluation results show no explanation methods consistently improve predictions over the no-explanation control.",
    "validation": "ALMANACS scenarios are designed to test distributional shifts in model behavior."
