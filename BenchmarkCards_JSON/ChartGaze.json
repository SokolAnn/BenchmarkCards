    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics calculated based on the alignment of model-derived attention maps with human gaze data and the percentage of questions answered correctly.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores in CC and SIM indicate better alignment of model attention with human gaze and higher accuracy reflects improved understanding.",
    "baseline_results": "LVLMs fine-tuned with gaze-guided attention refinement improved accuracy by up to 2.56 percentage points over those trained with language loss alone.",
    "validation": "The dataset was validated through human annotation and gaze data quality controls including filtering for accuracy."
