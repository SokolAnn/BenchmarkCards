    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We present our first efforts in building a code-switching ASR system in the Indian context by creating a Hindi-English code-switching speech database. The database contains speech utterances with code-switching properties and covers session and speaker variations such as pronunciation, accent, age and gender. The database can be applied in speech signal processing applications such as code-switching automatic speech recognition, language identification, language modeling, and speech synthesis.",
