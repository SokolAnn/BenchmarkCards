    "overview": "This paper presents the first conversational agent that supports the full generality of hybrid data access for large knowledge corpora through the Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL). It introduces a semantic parser capable of handling hybrid data sources and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on the HybridQA dataset, achieving strong performance in combining structured data queries and free-text retrieval techniques.",
