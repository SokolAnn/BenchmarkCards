    "abbreviation": "SARChat-2M",
    "overview": "This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompassing diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks and serves as the first visual-language benchmark in the SAR domain.",
