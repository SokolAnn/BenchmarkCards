This paper also presents a new Hate Speech Detection Video Dataset (HSDVD) collected for the purpose of multimodal learning as no such dataset exists today.",

    "calculation": "Macro-average of precision, recall, and F1-score computed across both classes for hate speech classification. Emotion attributes evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Binary prediction threshold set to 0.7 for final classification. Loss functions: weighted Mean Square Error (MSE) for the MTL emotion model; binary cross-entropy with L2 regularization for the multimodal model.",
    "interpretation": "Higher macro-average Precision/Recall/F1 indicates better hate speech detection performance. Lower RMSE indicates better emotion attribute prediction. The authors interpret increases in precision and recall of the multimodal model relative to text-only baselines as evidence that incorporating speech emotion features improves multimedia hate speech detection.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline text model (examples): BERT_A baseline — Precision 90.50, Recall 91.73, F1 91.11; ALBERT_B baseline — Precision 90.20, Recall 91.99, F1 91.08. Multimodal top result (for comparison): BERT_A_CLS — Precision 93.00, Recall 92.89, F1 92.94.",
    "validation": "Dataset split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%). Validation set used for hyperparameter tuning and selecting best epoch based on validation loss. Early stopping applied (stop if validation loss does not decrease for more than 10 epochs). Emotion model hyperparameters tuned using validation loss (hyperband)."
