    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We present the PrivaSeer Corpus of 1,005,380 English language website privacy policies collected from the web. We describe a corpus creation pipeline (web crawler, language detection, document classification, duplicate and near-duplicate removal, and content extraction), employ unsupervised topic modelling to investigate corpus contents, analyze relationships between privacy policy domain PageRanks and text features, and use the corpus to pretrain PrivBERT, obtaining state of the art results on data practice classification and question answering tasks.",

    "goal": "To provide a large-scale corpus of contemporary website privacy policies (1,005,380 documents) to enable large-scale semi-supervised and unsupervised models to interpret and simplify privacy policies, to support in-domain pretraining of language models (PrivBERT), and to facilitate research on privacy policy analysis and automated extraction of salient details.",

Sentence-level F1 for question answering: precision and recall calculated by measuring overlap between predicted sentences and gold standard sentences (per Ravichander et al., 2019). Readability measured using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. PageRank values computed from Common Crawl web graphs using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm as described in the paper.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Precision, Recall, and F1 indicate better model performance. The paper reports PrivBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving RoBERTa's macro-average F1 by about 4% on the data practice classification task and improving BERT's F1 by about 6% on the answer sentence selection task. A higher Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level indicates greater required education level to understand a policy (mean FKG = 14.87). Higher PageRank indicates more popular domains which tend to have longer policies and cover more topics.",

Answer sentence selection: BERT Precision 0.442 Recall 0.348 F1 0.39; PrivBERT Precision 0.483 Recall 0.424 F1 0.452.",
    "validation": "Document classification: the 1,600 labeled documents were split into 960 training, 240 validation, and 400 test documents; 5-fold cross-validation was used to tune hyperparameters and average test results. OPP-115 fine-tuning split: 3:1:1 for training, validation, and testing. PrivacyQA: 1,350 questions for training and validation and 400 questions for testing (test questions annotated by at least three experts)."
