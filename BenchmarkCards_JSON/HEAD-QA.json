    "abbreviation": "HEAD-QA",
    "overview": "HEAD-QA is a multi-choice question answering testbed composed of graduate-level questions from Spanish public healthcare specialization exams, intended to encourage research on complex reasoning in QA. The questions require specialized knowledge and reasoning and are challenging even for highly specialized humans; the dataset is provided in Spanish with an English translation and is evaluated in monolingual and cross-lingual settings.",

    "limitations": "HEAD-QA includes images for a small percentage (~14%) of medicine questions but these images are included without being exploited in this work; radiophysics exams were excluded due to difficulty parsing equations from PDFs; the English version is an automatic Google API translation and shows issues with elements such as molecular formulae (translation adequacy and fluency were evaluated).",

    "interpretation": "HEAD-QA is challenging: model performance is substantially below human performance. Higher Accuracy and POINTS indicate better performance; human and pass mark POINTS are reported for comparison to show the gap between models and humans.",
    "baseline_results": "Unsupervised setting: best average Accuracy reported for cross-lingual IR (ENIR) was 34.6% (Table 5) and ENIR average POINTS 87.6 (Table 6). Supervised setting: ENIR average Accuracy 37.2% (Table 7). Human performance (10 best) POINTS averages (Table 9): BIR 627.1, MIR 592.2, EIR 515.2, FIR 575.5, PIR 602.1, QIR 529.1. Pass marks (Table 9): BIR 219.0, MIR 207.0, EIR 180.0, FIR 201.0, PIR 210.0, QIR 185.0.",
    "validation": "Official supervised splits defined by exam years (training: 2013-2014 exams; development: 2015; test: remaining years) to allow comparison with official human aggregated results. English translation quality was evaluated on a sample of 60 random questions: adequacy scores by two fluent Spanish-English speakers averaged 4.35 and 4.71 out of 5; fluency scored 4 out of 5 by a native English speaker."
