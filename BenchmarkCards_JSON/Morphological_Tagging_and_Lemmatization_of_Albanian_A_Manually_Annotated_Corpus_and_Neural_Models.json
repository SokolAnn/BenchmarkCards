    "name": "Morphological Tagging and Lemmatization of Albanian: A Manually Annotated Corpus and Neural Models",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "The paper presents the first publicly available part-of-speech and morphologically tagged corpus for the Albanian language, and a neural morphological tagger and lemmatizer trained on it. The corpus contains about 118,000 tokens of naturally occurring text collected from different text sources, with an addition of 67,000 tokens of artificially created simple sentences used only in training. The annotated corpus and trained models are made publicly available under an open license.",

Dataset split: Training: 160,532 tokens (includes 66,911 artificial tokens), Development: 11,375 tokens, Test: 12,690 tokens.",
    "format": "CoNLL-U formatted corpus (Universal Dependencies annotation)",

    "interpretation": "The authors state that the performance of each step of the pipeline is at a sufficiently high level to support many downstream NLP applications in practice.",

    "validation": "Sentences from the same document are grouped into the same split to avoid lexical overlap. All artificially created UniMorph sentences are placed into the training section to avoid optimistic evaluation. Development set used for early stopping; held-out test set preserved for final evaluation."
