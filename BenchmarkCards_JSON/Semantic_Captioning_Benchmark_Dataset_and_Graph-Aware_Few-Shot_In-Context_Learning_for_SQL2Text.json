    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper introduces semantic captioning as a new task that focuses on translating SQL queries into natural language utterances. It develops the first dataset for semantic captioning using iterative in-context learning (ICL) techniques, contributing to the understanding of code comprehension by large language models (LLMs) and generating meaningful descriptions of SQL queries.",

    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate better alignment, semantic accuracy, and logical consistency between the generated captions and the SQL queries they represent.",
    "baseline_results": "Evaluation revealed strong inter-rater reliability with Fleiss’ Kappa κ= 0.802, demonstrating high-quality caption generation.",
    "validation": "The dataset and model performance were assessed through a structured evaluation framework involving human experts."
