    "calculation": "CSR is calculated by the proportion of individual constraints met, while ISR measures the percentage of instructions with all constraints satisfied.",
    "interpretation": "Higher CSR and ISR indicate better performance in following complex and constraint-laden instructions.",
    "baseline_results": "Current LLMs show poor performance, with the best model achieving a CSR of only 59.8.",
