    "name": "LREBench (Low-resource Relation Extraction Benchmark)",
    "abbreviation": "LREBench",
    "overview": "We create a benchmark with 8 relation extraction (RE) datasets covering different languages, domains and contexts to evaluate methods for building relation extraction systems in low-resource settings and perform extensive comparisons over prompt-based methods, balancing methods for long-tailed distributions, and leveraging more instances via data augmentation and self-training.",
    "data_type": "Text instances with one entity pair (head and tail) and a relation label (text (entity pair, relation))",

    "calculation": "Macro F1 and Micro F1 computed on test sets. For 8-shot and 10% settings, training datasets are randomly sampled 5 times and reported results are the average over the 5 runs.",
    "interpretation": "Macro F1 and Micro F1 are used together because head and tail class performance varies a lot; Macro F1 reflects per-class (including tail) performance while Micro F1 reflects overall instance-level performance.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline results are reported in Table 2: Macro F1 and Micro F1 (%) for PLM fine-tuning, prompt-based tuning (KnowPrompt), balancing methods, data augmentation, and self-training across 8 datasets and three training settings (8-shot, 10%, 100%).",
    "validation": "No validation on development sets; models are trained only on training sets to ensure few-shot learning. For 8-shot and 10% settings, experiments are repeated with 5 random training samples and averaged. Training epoch is set to 10."
