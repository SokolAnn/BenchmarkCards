    "name": "SUV (Selective Unlearning for Verbatim data)",
    "abbreviation": "SUV",
    "overview": "SUV is a selective unlearning framework designed to prevent large language models from memorizing copyrighted content while preserving overall model utility. It constructs a dataset of copyrighted infringement cases to apply Direct Preference Optimization for unlearning, ensuring the model's performance on unrelated tasks remains intact.",

    "interpretation": "Lower ROUGE-L scores indicate better unlearning performance metrics.",
    "baseline_results": "Compared against baselines such as Vanilla model, Stable Sequential Unlearning (SSU), Gradient Ascent (GA), and Negative Preference Optimization (NPO).",
    "validation": "Validated using experiments that measure unlearning performance and downstream task efficiency."
