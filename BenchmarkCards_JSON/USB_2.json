  "data": {
    "source": "Curated from existing safety benchmarks and supplemented with synthetic data.",
    "size": "18,126 samples",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "Annotated for risk category, modality combinations, image style, and data source."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics",
      "Human evaluation"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Attack Success Rate (ASR)",
      "Average Refusal Rate (ARR)"
    ],
    "calculation": "ASR calculates the percentage of harmful queries that bypass safety safeguards, while ARR measures the refusal rate on harmless inputs.",
    "interpretation": "Lower ASR and ARR scores indicate better alignment and safety.",
    "baseline_results": "Varies across evaluated models; commercial MLLMs generally exhibit lower ASR compared to open-source counterparts.",
    "validation": "Extensive experiments conducted using various mainstream open-source and commercial MLLMs."
