    "abbreviation": "CMMU",
    "overview": "CMMU is a novel benchmark for multi-modal and multi-type question understanding and reasoning in Chinese. It consists of 3,603 questions in 7 subjects, covering knowledge from primary to high school, featuring multiple-choice, multiple-response, and fill-in-the-blank questions.",
