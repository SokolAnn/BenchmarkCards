      "Overpass Query Similarity (OQS)",

    "calculation": "OQS includes character F-score (chrF), key-value similarity (KVS), and tree similarity (TreeS) computed from the generated and reference queries.",
    "interpretation": "Values close to 1 for execution metrics indicate high accuracy of the generated queries compared to the reference.",
    "baseline_results": "The best model for our task is ByT5-base, achieving notable execution accuracy compared to other models.",
    "validation": "The quantitative performance is validated by executing queries against the OpenStreetMap database and comparing the outputs."
