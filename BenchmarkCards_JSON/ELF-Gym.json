    "abbreviation": "ELF-Gym",
    "overview": "ELF-Gym is a framework for evaluating LLM-generated features by curating a dataset that includes 251 expert-crafted features from top-performing teams in Kaggle competitions. It quantifies LLM-generated features' impact on model performance and compares semantic and functional similarities with human-engineered features.",
