    "name": "TEAI (Task Exposure to AI) and TRAI (Task Replacement by AI) Indexes",
    "abbreviation": "TEAI, TRAI",
    "overview": "This paper develops a reproducible framework that assesses job exposure to AI and robotics through the TEAI index, which measures the extent to which AI can perform job-related tasks, and the TRAI index, which measures task substitutability by AI. The framework uses large language models to assess the performance potential of AI across various occupations and tasks.",

  "data": {
    "source": "The data for the TEAI and TRAI indexes is derived from O*NET, which includes descriptions for over 19,000 tasks across 1,000 occupations assessed by large language models (LLMs).",
    "size": "19,281 tasks across 1,016 occupations",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "The tasks are evaluated by LLMs based on their ratings of how well AI technologies can perform each task."

    "calculation": "TEAI is calculated by aggregating task assessment ratings weighted by task relevance, importance, and frequency from O*NET.",
    "interpretation": "Higher TEAI scores indicate higher potential AI capability in job tasks; TRAI measures the extent of task substitution.",
