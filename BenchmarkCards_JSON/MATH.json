    "calculation": "Conditional entropy is computed as the average uncertainty of the model about the final answer given the context and reasoning steps.",
    "interpretation": "Decreasing conditional entropy over steps indicates better reasoning and higher likelihood of correct answers.",
    "baseline_results": "LLM accuracy was measured against human solutions, e.g., LLM accuracy on MATH dataset problems varied from 0.63 to 0.95.",
    "validation": "Results were validated using a mix of LLM outputs and human reference solutions."
