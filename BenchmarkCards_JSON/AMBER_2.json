    "name": "AMBER (An LLM-free Multi-dimensional Benchmark for MLLMs Hallucination Evaluation)",
    "abbreviation": "AMBER",
    "overview": "AMBER is a multi-dimensional benchmark designed for evaluating hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It assesses generative and discriminative tasks involving existence, attribute, and relation hallucinations without requiring additional LLMs.",
    "data_type": "image with annotations",
    "domains": [

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To provide a cost-effective and efficient evaluation benchmark for hallucination in MLLMs across various types of hallucination and tasks.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Industry Practitioners",
      "Model Developers"

    "tasks": [
      "Generative Task",

    "limitations": "AMBER offers limited evaluation for attributes and relations because it does not guarantee effective generative descriptions.",

    "size": "1,004 images",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manually annotated by multiple groups of annotators covering existence, attributes, and relations."

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on responses obtained from MLLMs using specific prompt templates designed for evaluation.",
    "interpretation": "Lower values in CHAIR and Hal indicate fewer hallucinations. A higher F1 indicates better performance in correctly detecting objects.",
    "baseline_results": "2023 evaluations of GPT-4V and other mainstream models show variation in hallucination scores.",
    "validation": "Evaluation tested across multiple MLLMs including GPT-4V, MiniGPT-4, and others."
