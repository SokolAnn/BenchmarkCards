The dataset improves the news collection process and event coding software and provides a processing pipeline to produce daily-updated data.",

    "limitations": "Geolocation is not fully implemented/accurate; processing time is high due to deep parsing; requires human-in-the-loop updates for actor dictionaries; realtime scraping can experience server failures or scraper bugs causing drops in data; no publicly-available gold standard is available for definitive validation.",

    "source": "Scraped content from 450 English-language news sites (RSS-based scraping) ingested hourly; processed with Stanford CoreNLP for deep parses; event coding performed with PETRARCH and PETRARCH2 using the CAMEO ontology; actor dictionaries from the Open Event Data project; geolocation via CLIFF and CLAVIN heuristics.",

    "calculation": "Correlation between Phoenix and ICEWS daily event counts computed over overlapping period; reported overall Pearson correlation = 0.31, rising to 0.49 when days with fewer than 1,000 Phoenix events are excluded. Event counts are aggregated per day. GoldsteinScore is the standard scale used in prior datasets (as implemented in Phoenix). QuadClass derived from mapped CAMEO root categories into classes 0-4 as described in the paper.",
    "interpretation": "Higher daily event counts indicate more media-reported events; QuadClass and GoldsteinScore provide event valence/intensity measures; Pearson correlation with ICEWS is used to assess similarity of aggregated signal but does not imply ground-truth accuracy. Face validity assessed via case study (Syria subset).",
    "baseline_results": "Phoenix: 254,060 events over 102 days (average ~2,200 events/day). Comparison with ICEWS over overlapping period shows broad similarity; Pearson correlation = 0.31 overall, 0.49 when excluding days with <1,000 Phoenix events.",
    "validation": "Face validity checks (case study on Syria) and system/data-level comparison to ICEWS. No public gold-standard ground-truth dataset available for definitive validation; referenced IARPA OSI ground-truth work is not publicly available."
