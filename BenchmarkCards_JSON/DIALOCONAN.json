    "limitations": "The dataset is English-only; seed DIALO gold is small (222 dialogues) and PAIRS gold is a subset extracted from Fanton et al. (2021). The dataset dialogues have strictly controlled numbers of turns (4, 6, or 8) which might not reflect more natural turn counts. The final data obtained via human-machine collaboration may not match the quality obtainable by niche sourcing the whole dataset to skilled NGO operators. Translating the dataset to other languages may lose cultural and contextual nuances.",

(2021) dataset (originally 5,000 HS/CN pairs) aligned to the 6 targets; plus machine-generated dialogues produced via 19 hybrid author configurations (concatenation, paraphrasing, and LM generation) and post-edited by trained reviewers.",

    "annotation": "Post-editing by trained annotators: three annotators (internship students) were extensively trained following Fanton et al. (2021) methodology and session-specific guidelines; annotators post-edited machine-generated dialogue candidates in an author-reviewer pipeline; mitigation procedures for annotator welfare were applied (work limits, breaks, weekly meetings, explanation of prosocial research aims)."

    ],
    "calculation": "HTER measures post-editing effort (used as efficiency metric); a value above 0.4 is considered to indicate low quality outputs. Novelty is computed via Jaccard similarity against reference dialogues. Repetition Rate (RR) measures language diversity using the rate of non-singleton n-gram types. Syntactic metrics are computed at turn-level as reported in the paper.",
    "interpretation": "Higher HTER and higher turn deletion indicate lower efficiency/higher post-editing effort (HTER > 0.4 generally signals low-quality outputs). Higher turn swap indicates need to reorder content; higher Novelty indicates greater lexical difference from reference/gold data; lower RR after post-editing indicates increased diversity. Syntactic depth metrics indicate complexity of generated turns.",

    "validation": "Training/dev/test splits for generation models used an 8:1:1 ratio. Annotators practiced on a small training set and guidelines were updated iteratively. A senior NGO expert performed a qualitative evaluation on a random sample of post-edited dialogues and approved dialogues from each session. Annotator training and session-specific reviewing procedures were used to validate data quality."
