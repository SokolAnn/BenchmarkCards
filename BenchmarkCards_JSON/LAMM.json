    "abbreviation": "LAMM",
    "overview": "LAMM is an open-source Language-Assisted Multi-Modal instruction-tuning dataset, framework, and benchmark that provides instruction-response data and an evaluation suite to train and evaluate Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on 2D (images) and 3D (point cloud) vision tasks. It includes a dataset for instruction tuning, an extensible MLLM training framework, and a benchmark with two novel evaluation strategies (GPT Metric and Binary Locating Metric) and traditional task-specific metrics.",

    "goal": "To establish LAMM as a growing ecosystem for training and evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by providing a Language-Assisted Multi-Modal instruction tuning dataset, an extensible training framework, and the first quantitative benchmark for MLLMs across diverse 2D and 3D vision tasks.",

    "limitations": "Dataset: generated partly via GPT-API which lacks direct access to visual information and can produce factually incorrect or biased outputs; generated data may reflect inherent biases and truthfulness issues of the GPT model used. Benchmark: metrics may fluctuate due to diversity of language outputs; GPT-eval and binary localization are initial attempts and require further research to improve stability. Framework: provided as a primary baseline with potential for further development.",

    "size": "186,098 image-language instruction-response pairs; 10,262 point cloud-language instruction-response pairs. Benchmark: 2D evaluation uses 11 datasets with over 62,439 samples; 3D evaluation uses 3 datasets with over 12,788 samples.",
    "format": "Multi-modal training data formatted as text sequences with special vision tokens (<Img>, </Img> for images; <Pcl>, </Pcl> for point clouds) and tokenized with SentencePiece; vision features represented as 256 tokens (CLIP ViT-L/14 for images) and point-cloud tokens encoded (PointNet++ then CLIP encoder). Training objective: next-token prediction loss over response text.",
    "annotation": "Instruction-response pairs generated via GPT-API using self-instruction methods and template pools; many pairs are converted from original dataset annotations (captions, bounding boxes, relations, Bamboo knowledge labels). Manual quality control: iterative cold-start manual checks and random 10% manual sampling to filter formatting issues and incorrect answers."

    "calculation": "Traditional Metrics: task-specific standard calculations (e.g., Accuracy for classification/VQA, mAP@0.5 for detection, BLEU-4 for captioning, MAE for counting, Word Accuracy for OCR, PCK for keypoints). Binary Locating Metric: predicted location is considered correct if it falls within the object's ground-truth bounding box. GPT Metric: prompt GPT with task definition, question, and candidate model outputs; GPT assigns scores based on accuracy, relevance, fluency, logical coherence, and information richness; average scores used as metric. Entity extraction: use NLTK and regex to extract noun entities, numbers, and bounding-box coordinates from textual outputs for metric calculation.",
    "interpretation": "Higher values indicate better performance for each metric (e.g., higher Accuracy, higher mAP, lower MAE). Binary Locating Metric measures coarse localization ability (binary correct/incorrect). GPT Metric measures judged relevance and quality of generated text beyond surface-token overlap, intended to complement or replace BLEU for long/detailed outputs.",

Binary-Loc Metric (LAMM baseline) 31.2; GPT Metric (LAMM baseline) 48.44.",
    "validation": "Validation includes zero-shot evaluation on datasets with no overlap with training data and fine-tuning experiments on mainstream tasks. Data quality validated via iterative manual cold-start checks and random manual inspection of 10% of generated data. Benchmark validated by running >200 experiments comparing multiple existing MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA, MiniGPT4, mPLUG-owl) and providing analyses."
