    "abbreviation": "EMScore",
    "overview": "EMScore is a novel reference-free metric for video captioning, which directly measures similarity between video and candidate captions. It combines matching scores of both coarse-grained (video and caption) and fine-grained (frames and words) levels.",

    "goal": "To develop a reference-free metric for evaluating video captions that better aligns with human judgment.",

      "Human correlation",

      "Spearman's rank correlation"
    ],
    "calculation": "EMScore is calculated as the average of coarse-grained and fine-grained embedding matches.",
    "interpretation": "Higher EMScore indicates a better quality caption, reflecting its consistency with the video.",
    "baseline_results": "EMScore shows higher human correlation than existing metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and CIDEr.",
    "validation": "V ATEX-EVAL and ActivityNet-FOIL datasets were used for validation."
