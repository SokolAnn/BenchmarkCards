    "limitations": "The dataset primarily focuses on disease outbreak news reports obtained from ProMED-mail, which may introduce bias towards certain types of outbreaks or regions. The annotation process is subjective and relies on human annotators, which can introduce potential biases and inconsistencies. The dataset predominantly focuses on English-language news articles, limiting its generalizability to other languages and regions.",

  "data": {
    "source": "1,508 samples from reported news articles, open emails, and alerts. Raw collection originated from ProMED-mail (initially collected 36,788 raw ProMED-mail alerts from December 2009 to December 2021); candidate selection and manual searches on ProMED, Wikipedia, and media news platforms were used to supplement sparse cases.",
    "size": "1,508 examples",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Annotation performed by a professional annotation company using a LabelStudio interface. Question selection and sample filtering were done with Ph.D.-level experts in epidemiology and public health. Annotation pipeline includes ethics check, feasibility check, preliminary annotation, consistency checks, quality checks, expert feedback, and four annotation batches (40, 710, 110, 660 samples)."

    "interpretation": "The paper reports that supervised models (fine-tuned on BAND) outperform zero-shot ChatGPT for NER and QA. For QA, decoder-only models generally outperform encoder-decoder models; for EE, encoder-decoder models perform better than decoder-only models. Higher reported Accuracy / F1 indicates better model performance on the BAND tasks.",
