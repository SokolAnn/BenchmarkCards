    "abbreviation": "SentiQNF",
    "overview": "This study proposes a novel hybrid approach for sentiment analysis called Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (QFNN), which leverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the limitations of classical sentiment analysis algorithms. It was tested on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), demonstrating quantifiable performance improvements.",
