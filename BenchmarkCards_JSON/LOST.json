    "abbreviation": "LOST",
    "overview": "A psychology-grounded and expertly annotated dataset, LoST (Low Self esTeem), to study and detect low self-esteem on Reddit. The dataset comprises gold-standard annotations created using standardized clinical questionnaires (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, INQ-18) and expert-driven annotation guidelines to enable supervised learning for binary low self-esteem detection.",

    "interpretation": "MCC values closer to +1 indicate stronger prediction, values near 0 indicate random prediction, and values near -1 indicate poor models. Higher Accuracy/F1/MCC are treated as better; authors report improvements with augmented data and identify RoBERTa as best on original data and BERT as best on augmented data.",

(Precision/Recall/F1 for each class are reported in Table I of the paper.)",
