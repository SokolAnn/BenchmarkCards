    "limitations": "1) FLUE does not include abstractive generation or summarization tasks due to a lack of large, annotated datasets. 2) Social media data like Twitter and Reddit are not included in pre-training. 3) Models are trained and tested on English tasks and may not perform well on non-English text. 4) Difficulty obtaining vocabulary term lists for some domains may limit generalization. 5) Work is limited to encoder-based architectures.",

    "interpretation": "Higher metric values indicate better performance. For ranking metrics, a higher nDCG means more relevant documents are retrieved earlier and a higher MRR means the first relevant item is retrieved earlier. ΔMP denotes marginal improvement over FinBERT.",
