    "name": "DIFAIR: A Benchmark for Disentangled Assessment of Gender Knowledge and Bias",
    "abbreviation": "DIFAIR",
    "overview": "DIFAIR is a manually curated dataset aimed at assessing gender bias in language models by measuring their performance on gender-specific and gender-neutral instances while retaining useful gender knowledge. It introduces a gender invariance score that quantifies biased behavior and preservation of gender knowledge.",
    "data_type": "gender-specific and gender-neutral sentences",

      "Performance metrics based on gender invariance score"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Gender Invariance Score (GIS)"
    ],
    "calculation": "The gender invariance score is calculated as the harmonic mean of gender-specific score (GSS) and gender-neutral score (GNS).",
    "interpretation": "Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better performance in balancing gender fairness and knowledge retention.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "The dataset was validated with inter-annotator agreement of 86.6%."
