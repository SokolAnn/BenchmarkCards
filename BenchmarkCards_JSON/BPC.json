    "name": "Towards a Benchmark for Causal Business Process Reasoning with LLMs",
    "abbreviation": "BPC",
    "overview": "This work develops a benchmark to assess the ability of LLMs to reason about causal and process perspectives of business operations, which are referred to as Causally-augmented Business Processes (BPC). It includes a set of situations, questions, and deductive rules for assessing LLMs' reasoning abilities.",
