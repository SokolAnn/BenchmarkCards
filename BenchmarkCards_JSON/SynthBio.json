    "overview": "SynthBio is a new evaluation set for the WikiBio dataset, composed of structured attribute lists describing fictional individuals, mapped to natural language biographies. This dataset addresses noise and bias issues found in WikiBio by ensuring better balance with respect to gender and nationality.",

    "source": "The dataset consists of synthesized infoboxes and corresponding biographies generated with the aid of large language models and refined by human raters.",
    "size": "2,249 infoboxes and 4,692 biographies",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "Human raters modified the generated attribute lists and biographies for factual plausibility, fluency, and formatting."

    "calculation": "Metrics were calculated based on human evaluations comparing synthesized biographies to their corresponding infoboxes.",
    "interpretation": "Higher coverage indicates more attributes from the infobox are mentioned in the biography; higher faithfulness indicates the biography contains only information from the infobox.",
