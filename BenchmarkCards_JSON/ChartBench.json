    "calculation": "Acc+ measures MLLMs' performance through both positive and negative assertions, requiring correct judgment on visual logic; CoR determines the failure to utilize chart information effectively.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better comprehension of charts, while CoR measures susceptibility to random guessing in interpreting charts.",
    "baseline_results": "Different models were compared on performance metrics, indicating varying capabilities of MLLMs in understanding charts, particularly unannotated ones.",
    "validation": "Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on multiple models using the proposed benchmark."
