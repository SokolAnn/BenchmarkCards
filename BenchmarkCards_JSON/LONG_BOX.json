      "F1 Score"
    ],
    "calculation": "For classification tasks, accuracy is calculated, while F1 Score is used for multi-label classification tasks.",
    "interpretation": "Lower accuracy scores indicate challenges in handling long sequences, with an overall indication of model struggle as they achieve average scores of approximately 52%.",
    "baseline_results": "Achieved an average score of âˆ¼52% across the benchmarked models.",
    "validation": "Results were validated through extensive comparison across multiple LLMs and techniques for long sequence handling."
