    "name": "Multidimensional Evaluation Framework for LLM-based Recommenders",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "The paper proposes a reproducible multidimensional evaluation framework specifically for evaluating the performance of LLM-based recommenders. It introduces four new evaluation dimensions—history length sensitivity, candidate position bias, generation-involved performance, and hallucinations—on top of traditional utility and novelty metrics.",
