    "interpretation": "Higher F1 indicates better token/chunk labeling performance. The authors interpret superior macro-F1 and chunk-F1 scores as evidence that the combined ELMo-LSTM-CRF-HB model outperforms base models; no numeric thresholds for good vs. poor performance are provided.",
    "baseline_results": "For Drug–Disease Relations (per-token macro-F1): rand-LSTM-CRF: 48.2 ± 1.12; HB-CRF: 42.3 ± 0.30; ELMo-LSTM-CRF: 50.6 ± 0.64; ELMo-LSTM-CRF-HB: 51.9 ± 0.52 (Table 2).",
    "validation": "For datasets with predefined splits, hyperparameters were tuned with 5-fold cross-validation on the training set and evaluated on the test set. For datasets without predefined splits, the data were divided into five equal parts and evaluated with cross-validation; experiments were repeated three times to smooth random initialization variation. For the Drug–Disease Relations dataset, crowdsourced training labels were inferred via Expectation Maximization and evaluated against an expert-annotated test set (inter-annotator agreement between crowd-inferred labels and expert labels reported as 0.82)."
