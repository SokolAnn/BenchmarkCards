    "name": "Pragmatics Understanding Benchmark (PUB)",
    "abbreviation": "PUB",
    "overview": "PUB is designed to assess the pragmatic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through 14 tasks covering four pragmatics phenomena: Implicature, Presupposition, Reference, and Deixis, consisting of 28,000 data points.",

    "calculation": "Models are evaluated using length normalized Cloze prompting and Multiple Choice Prompting, measuring their performance on tasks.",
    "interpretation": "Models' performance is compared against human evaluators to assess understanding of pragmatic tasks.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Results are validated through human evaluation with a total of 4,200 samples assessed by three independent evaluators for each task."
