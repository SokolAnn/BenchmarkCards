    "abbreviation": "ELUDe",
    "overview": "ELUDe is the first dataset designed to evaluate entity-level unlearning, which involves removing all knowledge related to a specific entity while preserving the remaining model capabilities. It contains 20 real-world target entities and 144 unique neighboring entities, comprising a total of 15,651 forget samples and 90,954 retain samples.",
