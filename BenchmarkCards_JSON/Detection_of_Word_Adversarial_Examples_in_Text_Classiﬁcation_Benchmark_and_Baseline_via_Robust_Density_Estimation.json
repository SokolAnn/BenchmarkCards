    "size": "IMDB: 25,000 original test samples / 10,000 generated samples; AG-News: 7,600 original test samples / 7,600 generated samples; SST-2: 2,700 original test samples / 2,700 generated samples; Yelp: 38,000 original test samples / 5,000 generated samples.",

    "metrics": [
      "True Positive Rate (TPR)",
      "F1 Score",
      "Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)",
      "False Positive Rate (FPR) (used as thresholding parameter)"
    ],
    "calculation": "TPR is the fraction of true adversarial samples out of predicted adversarial samples. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. AUC measures the area under the TPR vs FPR curve. For TPR and F1 reported in experiments, FPR is fixed at 0.1.",
    "interpretation": "For all three metrics, higher denotes better performance. TPR and F1 depend on a chosen FPR; experiments fix FPR = 0.1 (10% false positive rate). AUC considers performance across FPR values.",
    "baseline_results": "RDE achieves the best performance by AUC on 29 out of 30 dataset-attack-model combinations and best performance by TPR, F1, AUC on 25 out of 30 combinations, outperforming FGWS, Perplexity (GPT-2), and MLE in the reported experiments.",
    "validation": "Validation procedures include subsampling and three repetitions of random seeds for test/validation split and subsampled samples. For IMDB and AG-News, 30% of the test set is held out as validation set in some experiments. Experiments are conducted under two scenarios (Scenario 1 and Scenario 2) for dataset configuration."
