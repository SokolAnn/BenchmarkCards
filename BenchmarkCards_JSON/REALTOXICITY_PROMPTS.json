    "overview": "REALTOXICITY PROMPTS is a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. It provides a testbed for evaluating toxic generations by language models and highlights the need for better data curation processes.",
