    "name": "Bridging Natural Language Processing and Psycholinguistics: computationally grounded semantic similarity datasets for Basque and Spanish",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We present a computationally-grounded word similarity dataset based on two well-known Natural Language Processing resources; text corpora and knowledge bases. This dataset aims to fulfil a gap in psycholinguistic research by providing a variety of quantifications of semantic similarity in an extensive set of noun pairs controlled by variables that play a significant role in lexical processing.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To create a computationally-grounded dataset of noun pairs that provides multiple quantifications of semantic similarity (text-based, WordNet-based and hybrid embeddings) controlled for concreteness, frequency, semantic neighbourhood density and phonological neighbourhood density, to support psycholinguistic experiments and NLP analyses.",

      "Embedding Evaluation"
    ],
    "limitations": "Dataset is restricted to single-word nouns (multiword expressions excluded) and to Basque and European Spanish; phonological neighbours and nouns with fewer than three characters were excluded; some external evaluation gold sets (e.g., RG) are small and may have low statistical power.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Derived from Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) linked to Princeton WordNet 3.0; Spanish 2018 Wikipedia dump (text corpora); Euscrawl corpus for Basque; WordNet-based pseudo-corpora generated by random walks; embeddings computed with fastText and hybrid mapping (vecmap) combining text and WordNet embeddings.",
    "size": "Spanish text corpus: 608 million tokens; Basque text corpus: 288 million tokens; WordNet-based pseudo-corpora: Spanish 406 million tokens (72 million random walks), Basque 166 million tokens (36.3 million random walks); WordNet lexicalizations: English 147,306 lexicalizations, Spanish 53,039 lexicalizations, Basque 26,701 lexicalizations. Feature dictionary sizes: various (e.g., concreteness dictionary Basque 19,660 entries, Spanish 14,771 entries as reported).",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Automatically computed: concreteness via WordNet hypernymy depth (averaged synset depths), semantic neighbourhood density via counting first-degree WordNet synset relations (averaged across synsets), phonological neighbourhood density via Levenshtein distance (distance <= 1), frequency via Zipf frequencies (wordfreq for Spanish; counts from Euscrawl for Basque converted to Zipf). No human annotation reported."

      "Cosine Similarity",

    ],
    "calculation": "Cosine similarity computed as the dot product of two vectors divided by the product of their Euclidean norms (range 0 to 1). Embedding similarity rankings compared to gold standards using Spearman correlation. Features L2-normalised and clustered with KNN (two groups: low/high) to form noun pairs sharing cluster membership across four features.",
    "interpretation": "Cosine similarity ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (complete similarity). Higher Spearman correlation between embedding-derived similarities and human gold standards indicates better alignment with human judgments. Hybrid embeddings (FThyb) are reported to show overall best Spearman correlation performance across datasets.",
    "baseline_results": "As reported in Table 3 (Spearman correlation results): Basque (EUBaseline) RG: 77.05, WS: 65.7; FTtxt RG: 77.86, WS: 73.31; FTkb RG: 85.67, WS: 65.88; FThyb RG: 86.55, WS: 74.57. Spanish (ESBaseline) RG: 87.9, WS: 57.8, SL: 36.58; FTtxt RG: 86.57, WS: 57.28, SL: 28.7; FTkb RG: 72.84, WS: 57.32, SL: 39.93; FThyb RG: 87.25, WS: 63.45, SL: 40.57.",
    "validation": "Embeddings and similarity measurements validated by computing Spearman correlations against existing gold-standard similarity/relatedness datasets (RG65, SimLex999, Wordsim353) in both languages and by comparing to baseline fastText embeddings."
