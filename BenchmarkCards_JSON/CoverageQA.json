    "overview": "CoverageQA is a benchmark of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, designed to assess generation diversity in language models.",
    "data_type": "question-answering pairs",

      "Natural Language Processing"

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To evaluate generation diversity from large language models by measuring their ability to recall valid solutions to underspecified questions.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Model Developers"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Text Generation"
    ],
    "limitations": "CoverageQA is sensitive to the model selecting meaningful axes in auto-stratification and correct joint probabilities in heuristic estimation.",

    "source": "Automatically generated from WikiData, ensuring a diverse and extensive benchmark.",

      "Recall Measurement"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Recall",
      "KL Divergence"
    ],
    "calculation": "KL Divergence is calculated between the model's output distribution and a uniform distribution over valid answers.",
    "interpretation": "Lower KL Divergence indicates a closer alignment with the desired uniform distribution; higher recall represents better diversity.",
    "baseline_results": "On CoverageQA, SimpleStrat achieves a 0.36 reduction in KL Divergence and a 0.05 increase in recall compared to baseline methods.",
    "validation": "Evaluated using both proprietary and open-source models on diverse underspecified questions."
