    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated by evaluating the fraction of times the correct result appears among the top K items in image-text retrieval tasks.",
    "interpretation": "Higher retrieval scores (e.g., R@1, R@5, R@10) indicate effectiveness in matching images and their corresponding text descriptions.",
    "baseline_results": "Best performance noted as 9.9% retrieval accuracy (R@1) using 100 distilled pairs.",
    "validation": "Performance metrics validated against original datasets (Flickr30K and COCO)."
