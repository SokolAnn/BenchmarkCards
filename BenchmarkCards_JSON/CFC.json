    "calculation": "The common sense evaluation is calculated by deriving a categorical distribution over answer clusters and measuring KL divergence between the ground truth and the model-generated answers.",
    "interpretation": "A lower KL divergence indicates a better performance of the model in capturing the common sense knowledge distribution.",
