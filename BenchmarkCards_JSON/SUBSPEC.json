    "abbreviation": "SUBSPEC",
    "overview": "SUBSPEC is a novel lossless and training-free technique designed to maximize inference throughput for offloaded large language models (LLMs) on consumer-grade devices. It constructs highly aligned draft models to effectively mitigate the latency due to parameter offloading, enabling competitive inference speeds with substantial speedups.",
