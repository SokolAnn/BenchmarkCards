    "calculation": "Accuracy calculated based on the proportion of correct answers, while Bias Score determined by comparing prediction frequencies of stereotypical versus anti-stereotypical responses.",
    "interpretation": "A higher bias score indicates greater reliance on social bias; ideal models have high accuracy with low bias scores.",
