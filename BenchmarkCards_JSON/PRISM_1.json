    "calculation": "Refusal Accuracy is calculated based on the percentage of correctly refused biometric-related queries; Leakage Protection Score reflects the extent of hidden biometric implications in model-generated responses.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate more effective refusal behavior and better protection against implicit biometric disclosure.",
    "baseline_results": "Safe-LLaV A models consistently achieve high refusal accuracy and low implicit leakage compared to baseline models.",
