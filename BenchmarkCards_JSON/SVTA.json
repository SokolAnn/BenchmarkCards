    "name": "SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark)",
    "abbreviation": "SVTA",
    "overview": "We introduce SVTA, the first large-scale dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to produce a dataset with 41,315 video-text pairs, covering 68 anomaly types and 30 normal activities to address data scarcity and privacy concerns.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on retrieval performance comparing text queries and video outputs.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Recall@K indicates better retrieval performance while lower Median and Mean Rank indicates better relevance in ranking.",
    "baseline_results": "CLIP4Clip achieved R@1 of 55.4% for T2V retrieval.",
    "validation": "The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 7:1:2."
