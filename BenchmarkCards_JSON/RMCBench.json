    "overview": "RMCBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to resist malicious code generation. It comprises 473 prompts designed for two scenarios: a text-to-code scenario where LLMs generate code based on descriptions, and a code-to-code scenario where LLMs complete or translate existing malicious code.",
