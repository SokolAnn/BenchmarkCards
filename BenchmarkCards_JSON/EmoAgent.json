    "overview": "EmoAgent is a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. It consists of EmoEval, which assesses risk of mental health deterioration in users after interactions with AI, and EmoGuard, which monitors and provides interventions to mitigate identified risks.",
