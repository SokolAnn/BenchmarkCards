    "overview": "COPYBENCH is a benchmark designed to measure both literal and non-literal copying in language model generations, evaluating how these models reproduce copyright-protected content while also considering model utility in terms of fact recall and fluency.",

    "goal": "To evaluate reproduction of copyright-protected text by language models, focusing on both literal and non-literal copying, alongside measuring the utility of the models.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Fictional works sourced from CliffsNotes and BookMIA, containing copyright-protected content.",

      "ROUGE-L",

    ],
    "calculation": "ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence between model outputs and source texts for literal copying. F1 Score is calculated for fact recall based on question-answer pairs.",
    "interpretation": "A higher ROUGE-L score indicates a higher degree of reproduction, while the F1 score measures the accuracy of model responses in fact recall tasks.",
    "baseline_results": "Comparative results of various language models on literal and non-literal copying metrics.",
    "validation": "Validation includes human evaluation of a sample of outputs to ensure automatic metrics align with human judgments."
