    "overview": "This project focuses on creating and publicly releasing a standard evaluation benchmark dataset for Igbo-English machine translation research for the NLP research community. The project aims to build, maintain and publicly share a standard benchmark dataset for Igbo-English machine translation research with objectives including creating a minimum of 10,000 English-Igbo human-level quality sentence pairs and assembling at least 100,000 monolingual Igbo sentences.",

    "limitations": "Data source limitations noted by the authors: OPUS Project training data has no human validations and may not be suitable as an evaluation benchmark; JW.ORG contents are human generated but genre skewed to religious contexts and may not be good for building a generalisable model. The dataset and quality improvements are ongoing.",

    "size": "11,584 parallel sentence pairs (5,836 IG-EN; 5,748 EN-IG); Monolingual Igbo: 383,449 sentences (5,724,201 tokens). Also stated project targets: minimum 10,000 parallel pairs and minimum 100,000 monolingual Igbo sentences.",

    "annotation": "Manual human translation (EN→IG and IG→EN) by 5 Igbo speakers; manual correction and checks by 3 additional Igbo speakers including an Igbo linguist. Cleaning processes include normalisation, diacritic restoration, and spelling correction."
