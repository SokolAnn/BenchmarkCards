    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper presents an empirical study on the ability of LLMs to obfuscate Python source code. It introduces a metric, 'semantic elasticity', to evaluate the quality of obfuscated code while maintaining functional correctness. The study compares the performance of three leading LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5, GPT-4-Turbo) on a dataset of 30 Python functions.",
