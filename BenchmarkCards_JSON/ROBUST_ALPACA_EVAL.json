    "overview": "ROBUST ALPACA EVAL is a new benchmark that consists of semantically equivalent case-level queries, designed to evaluate the worst prompt performance of large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. It emphasizes the importance of understanding model variability and robustness across diverse prompts by focusing on their worst-case performance.",
