    "overview": "We gather and make available the Pile of Law, a ≈256GB (and growing) dataset of open-source English-language legal and administrative data, covering court opinions, contracts, administrative rules, and legislative records. We also distill legal norms about privacy and toxicity into actionable lessons for researchers and demonstrate that implicit sanitization rules can be learned from the Pile of Law.",

    "goal": "Provide the Pile of Law dataset (≈256GB) of open-source English legal and administrative data; to catalog legal norms for handling privacy and offensive content; and to demonstrate how filtering rules can be learned from legal text to inform responsible data sanitization for language model pretraining.",

    "limitations": "Due to the expertise of the authors and the availability of data, this work focuses on the U.S. legal system; the collation is concentrated on U.S. texts because of licensing restrictions. The dataset may contain sensitive material that escaped administrative scrutiny. Pretraining experiments reported were run on a limited sample (≈30GB sample for pretraining) and initial models may be undertrained.",

    "calculation": "F1 measured on held-out validation sets (e.g., ≈80% F1 reported for the distil-BERT pseudonymity task). MLM Score computed as in Masked Language Model Scoring (difference in score between variants, e.g., 'Jane Doe' vs random name). Cohen's Kappa computed for inter-model agreement across time bins (10-year bins). Toxicity reported as model-assigned probability with >50% threshold for classification. Perplexity reported for pretrained models.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 indicates better pseudonymity prediction performance; larger MLM score differences indicate stronger encoding of pseudonymity norms; low Cohen's Kappa indicates disagreement between toxicity filters (i.e., inconsistent filtering); reductions in toxicity probability when adding context indicate sensitivity of filters to context length. The paper presents these interpretations in discussing model behavior and filter agreement.",
    "baseline_results": "Distil-BERT pseudonymity model: ≈80% F1 on validation. CaseHOLD evaluation (Table 7): CaseLaw-BERT (tuned) 78.5 F1; CaseLaw-BERT 75.4 F1; PoL-BERT-Large (tuned) 75.0 F1; Bert-Large-Uncased (tuned) 71.3 F1.",
    "validation": "Used held-out validation sets; CaseHOLD experiments used the train/validation/test split from the referenced work [30]; toxicity context experiments report 95% confidence intervals. Reproducibility materials (code and datasets) and experiment data/models are provided via HuggingFace and GitHub links."
