    "name": "The Copenhagen Corpus of Eye Tracking Recordings from Natural Reading of Danish Texts (CopCo)",
    "abbreviation": "CopCo",
    "overview": "CopCo is the first Danish eye tracking corpus with contextualized, running text and self-paced reading. The first release includes eye tracking data from 22 participants and contains 1,832 sentences with 34,897 tokens of Danish text extracted from a collection of speech manuscripts. The corpus is intended to make eye movement recordings from natural reading available for psycholinguistic research and natural language processing purposes.",
    "data_type": "Time-series eye-tracking recordings paired with Danish running text (character-level and word-level eye-tracking features)",

    "limitations": "First release contains recordings from 22 participants and 20 speeches (1,832 sentences, 34,897 tokens). Reading materials are limited to selected Danish speech manuscripts from 2010â€“2019; not all manuscripts used canonical punctuation and this may affect readability scores. The corpus is a growing resource and will be extended in future releases.",

    "interpretation": "Higher reading comprehension accuracy indicates adequate participant comprehension (mean accuracy reported as 82%). Extracted eye-tracking feature ranges are interpreted by comparison to similar corpora and are reported as 'in line with related research'.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Data quality assessed via analyses of reading comprehension scores, effects of word length and word frequency on skipping and fixation, landing position analyses at character level, and comparison of extracted word-level feature ranges to existing corpora (e.g., GECO and ZuCo). Fixations shorter than 100 ms were excluded from analysis."
