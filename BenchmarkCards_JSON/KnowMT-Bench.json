    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "KnowMT-Bench is the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) for large language models across knowledge-intensive fields including medicine, finance, and law. It features dynamic evaluation settings where models generate multi-turn dialogue histories given logically progressive question sequences, allowing for a thorough examination of factual capability and information delivery efficiency.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are evaluated based on the factual capability and information delivery efficiency of model responses compared against ground-truth answers.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate better factual accuracy and efficiency in delivering answers in a multi-turn dialogue context, while lower scores indicate factual degradation and verbosity.",
