    "overview": "To facilitate the development of LLMs in the Nordic languages, we curate a high-quality dataset consisting of 1.2TB of text in the major North Germanic languages (Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish), as well as some high-quality English data. The paper details considerations and processes for collecting, cleaning, and filtering the dataset.",

    "limitations": "The processed dataset cannot be distributed due to current European legislation; deduplication was constrained by available memory (machines with at most 256GB RAM) which required sharding and may affect completeness of deduplication; filter parameters were fixed for simplicity and not fully specialized per language.",

    "source": "Composite of multiple existing sources and some scraped/curated sources: Common Crawl derivatives (e.g., OSCAR, mC4, Web CC), The Pile subsets (ArXiv, PubMed, Books S3, Open Web Text, Stack Exchange), Wikipedia dumps, OPUS parallel data, Pushshift Reddit data, generated mathematics datasets, Code Parrot GitHub code corpora (Bash, JavaScript, Python, SQL), various web scrapes and other curated sources listed in Appendix C.",
    "size": "Final: 1,208.7 GB (1.2TB) of training data (659.48 million final documents). Collected before processing: 1,500.41 GB (1.5TB).",

      "Dataset-level statistics: total size in GB, per-language and per-category sizes and fractions, data removed per filter (GB), distribution of fuzzy duplicate group sizes"
    ],
    "calculation": "Language identification performed using fastText; MD5 computed as 128-bit hex string; document counts and size statistics computed after normalization and filtering. MinHash LSH used for fuzzy deduplication with p=10 hash functions, 10-character shingling, b=2 bands, Jaccard similarity threshold 0.5. Exact deduplication used MD5 hash set lookup.",
    "interpretation": "The pipeline reduced the collected data from 1.5TB to 1.2TB (approximately 300GB or ~20% removed). Quality filtering and fuzzy deduplication were the most prominent removal steps. The resulting dataset is intended to be sufficiently large and diverse to train multi-billion parameter LLMs in Nordic languages.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Validation comprised quantitative and qualitative evaluation of filter thresholds, analysis and visualization of data removed by each filter, distribution over duplicate group sizes, and per-language/category remaining data after pipeline steps. No model pre-training results or downstream evaluation provided in the paper."
