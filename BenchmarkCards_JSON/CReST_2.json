    "overview": "This paper introduces a novel two-step framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating annotations of team dialogues to track shared mental models (SMMs) and detect discrepancies in team member mental states. It presents a dataset of human and LLM annotations and a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence.",
