    "abbreviation": "AD-LLM",
    "overview": "AD-LLM is the first benchmark that evaluates how large language models (LLMs) can assist in natural language processing anomaly detection through three key tasks: zero-shot detection, data augmentation, and model selection.",

    "metrics": [
      "Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC)",

    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated as the area under specified curves, which are comparative evaluations across different anomaly detection methods.",
    "interpretation": "Higher AUROC and AUPRC values indicate better performance in distinguishing between normal and anomalous samples.",
    "baseline_results": "Compared LLM-based AD with 18 traditional unsupervised methods.",
    "validation": "Results validated through tests on multiple datasets, demonstrating LLM's performance across the benchmark tasks."
