    "overview": "Ref-Long is a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing capability of Long-context Language Models (LCLMs). It requires LCLMs to identify document indexes that reference a specific key within long-context data, emphasizing contextual relationships over simple retrieval.",
