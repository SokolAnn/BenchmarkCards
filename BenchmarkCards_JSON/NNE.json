    "name": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English",
    "abbreviation": "NNE",
    "overview": "We describe NNEâ€”a fine-grained, nested named entity dataset over the full Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (PTB). Our annotation comprises 279,795 mentions of 114 entity types with up to 6 layers of nesting. We publicly release the standoff annotations along with detailed annotation guidelines and scripts for knitting annotations onto the underlying PTB corpus. We hope the public release of this large dataset for English newswire will encourage development of new techniques for nested NER.",

    "limitations": "Complexity and run time are open challenges (decoding speed is slow for some models due to large number of entity categories). Dataset is limited to the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (English newswire).",

    "annotation": "Manual annotation by four annotators with detailed annotation guidelines and use of a custom annotation tool; sections 00 and 23 doubly annotated; section 02 annotated by all four annotators; adjudication performed (additional 17 hours); total annotation time 270 hours."

    "interpretation": "Flat NER models achieve high precision but suffer from low recall when applied to nested structures. Hypergraph-based model attains the best F1 on this dataset but has slow decoding speed (9 words/second). Transition-based method has higher decode speed (57 words/second) but lower precision than flat models.",

    "validation": "Inter-annotator agreement measured on Section 02 (annotated by all four annotators). Fleiss' kappa over all tokens: 0.907; Fleiss' kappa for tokens part of at least one mention: 0.832. Average precision, recall and F1 across four annotators w.r.t. adjudicated gold: 94.3, 91.8, 93.0."
