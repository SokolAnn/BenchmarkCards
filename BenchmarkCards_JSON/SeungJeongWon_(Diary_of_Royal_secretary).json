    "format": "Unicode text (digitized); prepared as two variants: with punctuation markers and without punctuation markers",

    "interpretation": "Higher Micro F1 and Flair quality scores indicate better NER performance; p < 0.005 in Welch's t-test is reported as statistically significant in the paper's comparisons.",
    "baseline_results": "Authors supply the best History NER model, which is Bert Path A at https://huggingface.co/Nara-Lab/History_NER. Table 3 reports mean quality scores for hypothesis tests (e.g., H1 A:0.8338, D:0.9055; H3 B:0.5141, E:0.4182).",
    "validation": "Validation via Welch's t-test on all quality numerical evaluation scores provided by Flair; experiments validated across six transfer-learning paths comparing past/future and punctuated/unpunctuated variants."
