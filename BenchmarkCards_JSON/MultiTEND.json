    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "MultiTEND is the first and largest multilingual benchmark for natural language to NoSQL query generation, covering six languages: English, German, French, Russian, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. It analyzes challenges in translating natural language to NoSQL queries across diverse linguistic structures.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing multilingual natural language to NoSQL query translation systems, facilitating research and development in this area.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Database Developers",

    "tasks": [
      "Query Generation",

  "data": {
    "source": "MultiTEND dataset derived from a semi-automated construction process combining machine-generated data and manual verification.",

      "Automated metrics"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Exact Match (EM)",
      "Execution Accuracy (EX)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics were calculated based on the percentage of generated queries that matched the ground truth queries exactly and those that executed correctly against the NoSQL database.",
    "interpretation": "Higher values in EM and EX indicate better performance; a successful query generation results in queries that conform to the expected structure and produce accurate execution results.",
    "baseline_results": "Comparison with other models like SMART and Zero-shot LLMs showed MultiLink's performance improvements of approximately 5% to 20%.",
    "validation": "Extensive experiments demonstrated its challenging nature and the effectiveness of the proposed model."
