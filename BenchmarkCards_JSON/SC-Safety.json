    "name": "SuperCLUE-Safety (SC-Safety)",
    "overview": "SC-Safety is a multi-round adversarial benchmark designed to systematically assess the safety of large language models (LLMs) in Chinese, featuring 4912 open-ended questions across more than 20 safety sub-dimensions. It aims to enhance the testing of models by incorporating multi-round discussions and adversarial interactions, going beyond conventional single-round assessments.",
