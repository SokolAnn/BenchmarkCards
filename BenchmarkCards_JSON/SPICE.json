    "overview": "SPICE is a diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large Language Model a YES/NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a userâ€™s behavior after reviewing a short transcript. It differentiates responses based on user tone and offers insights into the model's disposition toward interactions.",
