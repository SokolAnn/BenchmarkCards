    "name": "LIBRA (Local Integrated Bias Recognition and Assessment Framework)",
    "abbreviation": "LIBRA",
    "overview": "The LIBRA framework measures bias in large language models (LLMs) specifically within local contexts, tackling the challenges of inherent biases in LLMs when deployed in diverse cultural settings. It emphasizes the use of datasets sourced from local corpora, avoiding crowdsourcing, to evaluate and improve the sensitivity of LLMs to cultural diversity.",

      "Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)"
    ],
    "calculation": "The EiCAT score is computed using the distribution of logits associated with stereotypical and anti-stereotypical predicted outcomes normalized by knowledge boundary scoring.",
    "interpretation": "Higher EiCAT scores indicate reduced bias and better handling of local vocabulary by the model.",

    "validation": "The pipeline utilizes both qualitative and quantitative measures through expert reviews and statistical comparisons."
