    "name": "Exploring Graph Tasks with Pure LLMs: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Investigation",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of pure large language models (LLMs) on graph tasks, including node classification and link prediction, with a focus on instruction tuning and few-shot scenarios. It assesses the capabilities of LLMs in understanding graph structures and their robustness across various data conditions.",
