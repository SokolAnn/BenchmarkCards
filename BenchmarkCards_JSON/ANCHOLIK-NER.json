    "abbreviation": "ANCHOLIK-NER",
    "overview": "We introduce ANCHOLIK-NER, the first benchmark dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Bangla regional dialects, comprising 17,405 sentences distributed across five regions. The dataset was sourced from publicly available resources and supplemented with manual translations, ensuring alignment of named entities across dialects.",
