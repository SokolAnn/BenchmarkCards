    "abbreviation": "HLB",
    "overview": "This benchmark evaluates the humanlikeness of language models through 10 psycholinguistic experiments analyzing core linguistic aspects including sound, word, syntax, semantics, and discourse. It employs a comprehensive comparison between outputs from language models and human responses to assess the extent to which these models replicate human language patterns.",
