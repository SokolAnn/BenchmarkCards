    "name": "Numeracy for Language Models: Evaluating and Improving their Ability to Predict Numbers",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We explore different strategies for modelling numerals with language models (e.g. memorisation, digit-by-digit composition) and propose a novel neural architecture that uses a continuous probability density function to model numerals from an open vocabulary. We evaluate models on clinical and scientific datasets and propose evaluations that adjust for high out-of-vocabulary rates of numerals and account for their numerical value (magnitude).",

  "data": {
    "source": "Clinical: clinical records from the London Chest Hospital accompanied by tables with 20 numeric attributes. Scientific: paragraphs from Cornell's ARXIV repository (preprocessed ARXMLIV) where paragraphs reference a table and contain at least one number.",
    "size": "Clinical: 11,170 train instances; 1,625 dev instances; 3,220 test instances. Scientific: 14,694 train instances; 2,037 dev instances; 4,231 test instances.",
    "format": "Scientific: preprocessed ARXMLIV (custom XML). Clinical: not specified.",
    "annotation": "Automatically preprocessed and tokenized. Numerals normalized by removing thousands separators and leading zeros; special mathematical symbols tokenized separately. No manual annotation procedure is described."

    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics (per-token perplexity and adjusted perplexity)",

      "Median Absolute Error (MdAE)",
      "Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)",
      "Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Perplexity: PP_test = exp(H_test) where H_test is cross-entropy on test set. Adjusted Perplexity (APP) computed by redistributing probability mass of out-of-vocabulary classes uniformly over their seen types (see Eq. 13-14 in the paper). Regression metrics computed in standard form: RMSE, MAE, MdAE (absolute errors) and percentage variants MAPE and MdAPE (see Eq. 15-16 in the paper).",
    "interpretation": "Perplexity is sensitive to out-of-vocabulary rate; APP cancels the effect of differing OOV rates and allows direct comparison across models. RMSE and MAE are sensitive to scale and extreme errors; percentage metrics (MAPE, MdAPE) are scale-independent and preferred when data spans multiple scales. MdAE/MdAPE provide robustness to outliers.",
    "baseline_results": "Models compared: softmax, softmax+rnn, h-softmax, h-softmax+rnn, d-RNN, MoG (mixture of Gaussians), and a combination model. Hierarchical models substantially improved perplexity on the subset of numerals by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude (clinical and scientific datasets respectively) versus non-hierarchical variants. The combination model attained the best overall APP results on both datasets. The MoG model achieved the best MAPE on both datasets, reducing MAPE by 18% and 54% compared to the second best strategy on the clinical and scientific datasets respectively.",
    "validation": "Held-out development sets used for model selection and early stopping. Models trained with Adam optimizer, LSTM RNNs, dropout of 0.1, and early stopping; final evaluation reported on held-out test sets."
