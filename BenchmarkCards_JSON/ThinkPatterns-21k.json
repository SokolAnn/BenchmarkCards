    "overview": "ThinkPatterns-21k is a curated dataset comprising 21,000 instruction-response pairs collected from existing instruction-following datasets augmented with five distinct internal thinking patterns: unstructured thinking (monologue) and four structured variants (decomposition, self-ask, self-debate, and self-critic) for comprehensive evaluation of thinking patterns in large language models (LLMs).",

    "goal": "To facilitate research on the impact of various thinking types on model performance, particularly in large language models, by providing a dataset that combines instruction-response pairs with structured thinking patterns.",
