    "overview": "NLI-PT, the first Portuguese dataset compiled for Native Language Identification (NLI), includes 1,868 student essays written by learners of European Portuguese (L2) whose native languages (L1s) include Chinese, English, Spanish, German, Russian, French, Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Tetum, Arabic, Polish, Korean, Romanian, and Swedish. NLI-PT includes the original student text and four different types of annotation: POS, fine-grained POS, constituency parses, and dependency parses. The dataset was created by unifying data from existing Portuguese learner corpora and uniformly annotating them for research in NLI, Second Language Acquisition, and educational Natural Language Processing.",

    "limitations": "The dataset combines data from different source corpora with varying L1 distributions and topic distributions; the dataset is not balanced by topic which can lead to topic bias in NLI experiments. Only some source corpora were linguistically annotated originally and annotations had to be unified. Text length and topic representation are highly variable.",
