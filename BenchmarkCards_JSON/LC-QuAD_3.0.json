    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated by comparing generated SPARQL queries against gold-standard references and executing them against the knowledge base for execution-based metrics.",
    "interpretation": "Higher BLEU scores indicate better surface-level output quality, while execution-based metrics assess the correctness of the generated SPARQL queries.",
    "baseline_results": "Various Large Language Models including Phi-4 14B show performance on LC-QUAD datasets, with the best results serving as a baseline.",
    "validation": "Various training configurations assessed the impact of incorporating frame-based structured representations."
