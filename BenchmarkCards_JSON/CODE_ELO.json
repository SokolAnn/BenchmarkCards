      "Elo Rating"
    ],
    "calculation": "The Elo rating system used is based on the performance of models in contests and compares them against human ratings.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Elo ratings indicate better coding capabilities and performance relative to human participants.",
    "baseline_results": "Elo ratings of models achieved indicate their percentile rank compared to human participants.",
    "validation": "Validation through direct submission to the CodeForces platform, achieving zero false positives."
