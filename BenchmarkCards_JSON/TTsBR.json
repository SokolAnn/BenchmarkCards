    "source": "Tweets extracted from Twitter between January and July 2017 using the Python-Twitter wrapper for the Twitter API; focused on nine TV programs from three major Brazilian TV channels; tweets from official accounts and retweets were discarded.",

    "annotation": "Manual annotation by seven native speakers (from linguistics, journalism and computer science) following a written codebook; annotators could mark a 'doubt' checkbox; majority voting used to determine final label; supervisors annotated a portion to form a revised test set; Krippendorff's Alpha used to measure agreement."

    "validation": "A held-out test set of 2,001 documents was created (partially annotated by supervisors) for evaluation; Krippendorff's Alpha was used during agreement phases; final labels determined by majority voting."
