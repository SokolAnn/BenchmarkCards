    "abbreviation": "ModSCAN",
    "overview": "ModSCAN is a measurement framework developed to scan and evaluate the stereotypical bias within Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) regarding gender and race across different scenarios, including occupations, descriptors, and persona traits. It identifies the presence of biases and suggests mitigation strategies.",
