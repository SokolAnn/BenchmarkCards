    "name": "VILMA (Video Language Model Assessment)",
    "abbreviation": "VILMA",
    "overview": "VILMA is a task-agnostic benchmark designed to evaluate the video-language models (VidLMs) based on their fine-grained visuo-linguistic capabilities and temporal reasoning. It includes proficiency tests that assess basic competencies necessary for solving more complex tasks. VILMA aims to provide a thorough assessment of VidLMs and identify areas for improvement.",
