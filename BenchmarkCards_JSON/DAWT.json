    "abbreviation": "DAWT",
    "overview": "The DAWT dataset contains densely annotated Wikipedia texts where annotations include labeled text mentions mapping to entities (represented by their Freebase machine ids) as well as the type of the entity. The dataset contains a total of 13.6M articles, 5.0B tokens, 13.8M mention-entity co-occurrences, spans multiple languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Arabic), and densifies Wikipedia anchor links by 4.8× compared to original Wikipedia markup.",

    "goal": "Create a large-scale, high-precision, densely annotated Wikipedia dataset mapping text mentions to Freebase machine ids across multiple languages and provide derived datasets (mention/entity counts, co-occurrence counts, entity embeddings, Freebase-to-Wikidata mappings) to support NLP and IR research.",

    "limitations": "KB restricted to approximately 1,000,000 selected Freebase machine ids (subset of Freebase) due to resource and usefulness constraints; entity embeddings trained on 2.2B entity tokens (noted as less than GloVe's 6B tokens) which the paper cites as a possible reason for degraded performance at larger vector sizes.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Wikipedia Data Dumps (January 20th 2017) annotated and linked to a Freebase-based knowledge base of approximately 1,000,000 Freebase machine ids; derived datasets produced from these annotated Wikipedia texts include mention occurrence counts, entity occurrence counts, mention-entity co-occurrence counts, entity embeddings, and Freebase-to-Wikidata id mappings.",
    "size": "13.6M articles; 5.0B tokens; 13.8M mention-entity co-occurrences; KB: ~1,000,000 Freebase machine ids; entity occurrences: 2.2B total entity occurrences and 1.8M unique entities in documents; entity embeddings generated for ~1.6M entities; Freebase->Wikidata mapping counts (Same: 2,048,531; Different: 24,638; DAWT Only: 2,362,077; Google Only: 26,413).",
    "format": "JSON (annotated articles in JSON format); derived datasets available as counts/co-occurrence tables and embedding vector files.",
    "annotation": "Automatically generated mappings from mentions to Freebase machine ids and entity types by enriching Wikipedia markup using candidate dictionaries (from Wikipedia and Freebase), semantic alignment pruning (Jaccard, edit distance, LCS), co-occurrence statistics, and resolution heuristics; original Wikipedia hyperlinks replaced with Freebase ids."

    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy on the semantic analogy task indicates better entity embeddings; a 4.8× increase in anchor links indicates denser annotation coverage; mention/entity counts and co-occurrence probabilities provide priors for candidate selection in NER/EDL.",
    "baseline_results": "Entity embedding accuracy (semantic analogy average): 70.23% (50-dim), 69.73% (300-dim), 65.87% (1000-dim). GloVe word embeddings average accuracy: 53.21% (50-dim), 68.61% (100-dim), 76.91% (200-dim), 78.98% (300-dim). Link density: 4.8× more links than original Wikipedia. Dataset totals: 13.6M articles; 5.0B tokens; 13.8M mention-entity co-occurrences.",
    "validation": "Validated by reporting dataset statistics and increased link density (4.8×) and by evaluating entity embeddings on the semantic analogy task (using Mikolov test set after mapping to Freebase ids); also validated mappings by comparing Freebase->Wikidata mappings against Google's mappings."
