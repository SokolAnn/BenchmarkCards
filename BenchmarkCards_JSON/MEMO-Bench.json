    "overview": "MEMO-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the emotional analysis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It consists of 7,145 portraits representing six different emotions, generated by T2I models, and offers a framework for sentiment analysis, focusing on both generation capabilities and comprehension assessment.",
