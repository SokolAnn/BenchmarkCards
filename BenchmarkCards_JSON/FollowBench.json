    "abbreviation": "FollowBench",
    "overview": "FollowBench is a benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating five different types of fine-grained constraints. It employs a novel multi-level mechanism that adds constraints incrementally to evaluate models on various difficulties.",
