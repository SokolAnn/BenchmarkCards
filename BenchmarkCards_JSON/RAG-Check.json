    "name": "RAG-Check: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Performance",
    "abbreviation": "RAG-Check",
    "overview": "RAG-Check is a novel framework designed to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation systems. It includes two performance measures: the relevancy score (RS) for assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query and the correctness score (CS) for evaluating the accuracy of the generated response.",

    "interpretation": "A higher RS indicates better relevance of retrieved pieces to the query, while a higher CS signifies that the generated responses are accurate relative to the retrieved raw context.",
