    "abbreviation": "MedDialog",
    "overview": "To facilitate the research and development of medical dialogue systems, we build two large-scale medical dialogue datasets: MedDialog-EN and MedDialog-CN. MedDialog-EN is an English dataset containing 0.3 million conversations between patients and doctors and 0.5 million utterances. MedDialog-CN is a Chinese dataset containing 1.1 million conversations and 4 million utterances. To our best knowledge, MedDialog-(EN,CN) are the largest medical dialogue datasets to date. The dataset is available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/Medical-Dialogue-System",
