    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This study advances beyond surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models (LLMs) reason about others’ emotional states using contextual information, within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework, by curating a specialized ToM evaluation dataset to assess both forward reasoning—from context to emotion—and backward reasoning—from emotion to inferred context.",
