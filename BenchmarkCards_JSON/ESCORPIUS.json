    "overview": "ESCORPIUS is a Spanish crawling corpus obtained from near 1 PB of Common Crawl data. It is presented as the most extensive corpus in Spanish with a high-quality extraction, purification and deduplication pipeline, preserving document and paragraph boundaries and maintaining source web page URL and WARC shard origin for traceability and GDPR compliance.",

    "goal": "Provide a massive cleaned and deduplicated Spanish web crawl corpus that preserves document and paragraph boundaries, maintains traceability to original web sources, and offers high-quality data for training language models.",

    "limitations": "The authors prioritized quality over quantity, sacrificing corpus length and processing time for more certain Spanish language identification and cleaner data. The corpus is crawling-based only and the authors propose future work to extend it (e.g., create a The Pile-like Spanish corpus).",

Deduplication performed via the dLHF pipeline (document exact matching, paragraph normalization, and Locality Sensitive Hashing). Language identification validated by CLD2 followed by fastText.",
    "interpretation": "As argued by the authors, corpora for language modelling should be compared not only by size but also by quality and traceability; higher quality and traceability improve confidence in model proficiency and GDPR compliance.",
    "baseline_results": "Comparison to state-of-the-art Spanish or Spanish-excerpt corpora (from Table 1): OSCAR (Spanish size 381.9 GB, 51M docs, 42,829M words), mC4 (Spanish size 1,600 GB, 416M docs, 433,000M words), CC-100 (Spanish size 53.3 GB, 9,374M words), ParaCrawl v9 (Spanish size 24.0 GB, 4,374M words), ESCORPIUS (deduplicated size 322.5 GB, 104M docs, 50,773M words).",
    "validation": "Validation via a two-step language identification (CLD2 then fastText) to ensure Spanish language selection; deduplication validation discussed via dLHF process and comparison of resulting statistics; no human annotation validation reported."
