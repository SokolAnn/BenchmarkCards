    "name": "mmRAG (Modular Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation)",
    "abbreviation": "mmRAG",
    "overview": "mmRAG is a modular benchmark designed for evaluating multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It integrates queries from six diverse question-answering datasets covering text, tables, and knowledge graphs, enabling granular evaluation of RAG components such as retrieval accuracy and query routing.",
    "data_type": "question-answering pairs",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for multi-modal RAG systems that supports the direct evaluation of retrieval, query routing, and generation.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Integrated from six diverse question-answering datasets covering text, tables, and knowledge graphs.",
    "size": "5,124 queries, 90,998 documents, 3,201,548 chunks",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Annotations are based on standard information retrieval protocols, involving manual and automated relevance assessments."

    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)",
      "Mean Average Precision (MAP)",
      "Hits"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the relevance labels provided for each query and document chunk.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores in NDCG and MAP indicate better retrieval accuracy, while Hits measures the proportion of queries for which relevant results are found.",
    "baseline_results": "Achieved NDCG@1 of 0.617 and Hits@1 of 0.703 for the best-performing retriever (BGE).",
    "validation": "mmRAG's modular and multi-modal features are validated through comprehensive evaluation of various RAG implementations."
