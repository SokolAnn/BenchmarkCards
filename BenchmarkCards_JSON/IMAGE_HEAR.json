  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics (Fréchet Audio Distance, KL Divergence, Clip-Score, Classifier accuracy using PaSST)"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD)",
      "Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence)",
      "Clip-Score (CS)",
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "FAD: distance between multivariate normal distributions of features extracted by an audio classifier pre-trained on AudioSet. Clip-Score: adapted using Wav2Clip as audio encoder and the frozen CLIP image encoder; expectation of cosine similarity of resultant feature vectors multiplied by scaling factor γ=100; for videos each image CS is computed independently with the whole audio and averaged. KL Divergence: computed between class distributions of original samples and generated ones using PaSST audio classifier trained on AudioSet. For IMAGE HEAR there is no reference audio, so accuracy of the classifier on generated audio is reported.",
    "interpretation": "FAD measures distance between generated and real distributions (lower FAD indicates higher fidelity). Higher Clip-Score and higher Accuracy indicate better relevance to the visual condition. KL Divergence measures divergence between class distributions (lower is closer).",
    "baseline_results": "Selected results from Table 1 (as reported in the paper): Reference (real): CS 7.61, Accuracy 56.93%. SpecVQGAN [13] (1 Feats) on VGGSound: FAD 6.99, KL 3.19, CS 4.41, Accuracy 12.79%. SpecVQGAN (5 Feats) on VGGSound: FAD 6.81, KL 3.13, CS 4.54, Accuracy 14.44%. SpecVQGAN (212 Feats) on VGGSound: FAD 6.64, KL 3.10, CS 4.62, Accuracy 14.44%. Ours (IM2WAV) on VGGSound: FAD 6.41, KL 2.54, CS 7.19, Accuracy 35.77%. On IMAGE HEAR (single-image) Ours: CS 9.53, Accuracy 49.14% (other model numbers reported in Table 1 for baselines are also provided in the paper).",
    "validation": "Followed original VGGSound train/test splits. For IMAGE HEAR evaluation, the authors generated 120 audios per image class with each image used for an equal number of samples to ensure statistical significance."
