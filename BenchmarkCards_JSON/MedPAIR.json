    "abbreviation": "MedPAIR",
    "overview": "MedPAIR is a dataset designed to evaluate how physician trainees and large language models prioritize relevant information when answering medical question-answering (QA) questions. It includes 1,300 QA pairs with sentence-level relevance annotations from 36 physician trainees, allowing comparison between human and model relevance assessments.",

  "data": {
    "source": "The data is sourced from four existing QA benchmark datasets: MMLU (Precision Medicine), JAMA Clinical Challenge, MedBullets, and MedXpertQA, with additional annotations from physician trainees.",
    "size": "2,000 question-answer pairs",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "Annotations were performed by 36 physician trainees who labeled each sentence as 'High Relevance', 'Low Relevance', or 'Irrelevant'."

    "calculation": "Calculating sentence relevance labels through majority voting among annotators and assessing model performance before and after pruning contexts based on relevance.",
    "interpretation": "Performance is measured by the degree of accuracy improvements when irrelevant and low-relevance context is removed based on human annotations.",
    "baseline_results": "The baseline accuracy for LLMs before filtering contextual information ranged from 30% to 95.6%, with significant improvements observed after applying relevance filtering.",
    "validation": "Validation was conducted through comparison of annotated relevance with model-assigned relevance labels."
