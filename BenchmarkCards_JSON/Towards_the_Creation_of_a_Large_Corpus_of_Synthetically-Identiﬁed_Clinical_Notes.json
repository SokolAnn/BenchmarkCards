    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This work presents a first step toward creating a large synthetically-identiﬁed corpus of clinical notes and corresponding PHI annotations in order to facilitate the development de-identiﬁcation tools. Further, one such tool is evaluated against this corpus in order to understand the advantages and shortcomings of this approach.",

    "goal": "1. Provide first steps toward a corpus of clinical notes that have been synthetically-identified, meaning they have been de-identiﬁed and PHI has been replaced with reasonable surrogates. 2. Evaluate a baseline de-identiﬁcation system against this data in order to understand advantages and shortcomings of this approach.",

    ],
    "limitations": "The system created by Neamatullah et al. favors recall over precision as it introduces virtually no false negatives, while there are numerous false positives accounting for up to 15% of the PHI instances detected. Creation of the synthetically-identified dataset directly from the identified data is necessary so as not to unnecessarily introduce meaningless surrogate data. Using surrogate data may constrain the natural variety of names, places, and other entities that appear in notes (e.g., through misspellings); thus, making the task slightly easier. Patient identity coreference was not performed for this initial work.",

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Synthetically-identified notes were created by substituting surrogate values for annotated PHI. Names were chosen proportional to their frequency from the 2005 U.S. Census and hospitals were chosen uniformly from a list of U.S. hospitals. Initial efforts focused on patient names and hospitals."
