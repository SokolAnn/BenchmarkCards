    "name": "Multi-Target Counter Narrative Dataset to Fight Online Hate Speech",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper presents a novel human-in-the-loop data collection methodology for generating a multi-target expert-based dataset of hate speech and counter narratives (HS/CN). The resulting dataset contains 5000 pairs addressing various hate targets, including race, religion, sexual orientation, and more, and aims to facilitate the generation of non-aggressive responses to hate speech.",
