    "abbreviation": "RuBLiMP",
    "overview": "RuBLiMP is a benchmark consisting of 45 datasets, each including 1k minimal pairs that differ in grammaticality and isolate a linguistic phenomenon, covering various morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects specific to Russian. It utilizes open text corpora and expert-written perturbation rules to generate these pairs.",
