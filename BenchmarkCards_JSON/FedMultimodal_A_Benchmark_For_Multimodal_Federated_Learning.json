    "name": "FedMultimodal: A Benchmark For Multimodal Federated Learning",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We introduce FedMultimodal, the first federated learning benchmark for multimodal learning covering five representative multimodal applications from ten commonly used datasets with a total of eight unique modalities. FedMultimodal offers a systematic end-to-end FL pipeline (data partition, feature extraction, FL algorithms, and model evaluation) and provides a standardized approach to assess robustness against three common data corruptions in real-life multimodal applications: missing modalities, missing labels, and erroneous labels.",

    "limitations": "FedMultimodal currently does not cover several multimodal applications such as medical image analysis, autonomous driving, and virtual reality; the range of supported models is limited; only two basic fusion approaches (concatenation and attention) are included; label scarcity and privacy leakage remain open challenges noted for future work.",

Evaluation metrics are computed on validation/test splits according to each dataset's protocol.",
    "interpretation": "Attention-based fusion outperforms concatenation-based fusion in the majority of datasets and heterogeneity conditions; FedOpt often yields stronger baselines across tasks (with exceptions in low heterogeneity conditions); multimodal learning generally outperforms unimodal learning, though the performance gap is within 5% for most datasets. Missing modalities, missing labels, and erroneous labels each reduce performance, with erroneous labels causing the largest relative drops.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "For datasets with pre-defined partitions, experiments are repeated 5 times using different seeds; for datasets without pre-defined partitions, 5-fold cross-validation is used."
