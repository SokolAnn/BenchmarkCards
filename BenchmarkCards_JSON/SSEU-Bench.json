    "abbreviation": "SSEU-Bench",
    "overview": "SSEU-Bench is the first versatile audio understanding benchmark that explicitly accounts for energy differences between speech and non-speech audio, with both independent and joint understanding settings for speech, scene, and events.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To evaluate the audio understanding capabilities of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) in joint analysis of speech, scene, and events within the same audio clip.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Mixed audio samples consisting of clean speech clips from the VCTK corpus and non-speech background audio clips from existing SED datasets, curated to create varying SNR levels.",

      "Word Error Rate (WER)",
      "Macro-average Accuracy (mACC)",
      "Mean Average Precision (mAP)"
    ],
    "calculation": "WER is calculated based on the accuracy of transcribing spoken content, mACC evaluates classification accuracies for scenes, and mAP measures accuracy for event identification.",
    "interpretation": "Lower WER indicates better performance in speech understanding; higher mACC and mAP indicate better performance in scene classification and event tagging respectively.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "Results are validated through comparison with ground truth as well as across various models."
