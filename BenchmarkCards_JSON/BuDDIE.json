    "abbreviation": "BuDDIE",
    "overview": "BuDDIE is the first multi-task dataset of 1,665 real-world business documents that contains rich and dense annotations for Document Classification (DC), Key Entity Extraction (KEE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA).",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "The primary objective of the benchmark is to facilitate research in visually rich document understanding by providing a multi-task dataset that addresses three distinct tasks: Document Classification, Key Entity Extraction, and Visual Question Answering.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Industry Practitioners",

    "source": "Publicly available business entity documents from US state government websites.",

      "Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated according to standard practices in document classification, entity extraction, and question answering.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 scores indicate better model performance across tasks. For DC, macro F1 is used due to imbalanced classes; KEE uses weighted averages; VQA metrics include accuracy for boolean questions and ANLS for span questions.",
    "baseline_results": "The best baseline for each task includes BERT, RoBERTa, LayoutLM, LayoutLMv3, GPT4, and DocLLM, achieving F1 scores of 99.15 for DC, 89.97 for KEE, and 89.58 for VQA respectively.",
    "validation": "The dataset was validated through a two-round annotation process involving initial assignments and subsequent checks for agreement."
