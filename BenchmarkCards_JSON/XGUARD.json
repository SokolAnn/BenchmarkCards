    "abbreviation": "XGUARD",
    "overview": "XGUARD is a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. It categorizes model outputs into five danger levels (0â€“4), enabling a more nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures, using 3,840 red-teaming prompts sourced from real-world data.",
