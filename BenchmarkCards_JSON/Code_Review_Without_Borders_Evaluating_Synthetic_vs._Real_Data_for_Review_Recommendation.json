    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "The paper presents a novel approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic code review datasets by translating Java code changes into C++. This allows for training supervised classifiers in low-resource settings where labeled data is scarce, demonstrating that LLM-generated data can effectively approximate real-world review patterns.",

    "interpretation": "Higher values of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score indicate better performance in correctly classifying review needs.",
    "baseline_results": "Accuracy: 0.65, Precision: 0.64, Recall: 0.65, F1 Score: 0.64 for real data; Accuracy: 0.65, Precision: 0.65, Recall: 0.68, F1 Score: 0.66 for synthetic data.",
