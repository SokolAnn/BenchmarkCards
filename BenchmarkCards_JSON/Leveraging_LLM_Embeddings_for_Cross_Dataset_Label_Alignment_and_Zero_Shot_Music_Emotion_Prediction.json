    "name": "Leveraging LLM Embeddings for Cross Dataset Label Alignment and Zero Shot Music Emotion Prediction",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This work presents a novel method for music emotion recognition that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings for label alignment across multiple datasets and zero-shot prediction on novel categories. The method enables robust cross-dataset label alignment and facilitates zero-shot inference on new datasets with previously unseen emotion labels.",
