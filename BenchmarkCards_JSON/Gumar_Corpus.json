    "overview": "A large-scale corpus of Gulf Arabic consisting of 110 million words from 1,200 forum novels. The corpus is annotated for sub-dialect information at the document level. The paper also presents a preliminary study in the morphological annotation of Gulf Arabic including developing guidelines for a conventional orthography. The text of the corpus is publicly browsable through a web interface.",

    "annotation": "Document-level annotations: sub-dialect (dialect), novel name, writer name. Preliminary manual morphological annotation of around 4,000 words from four novels following extended CODA orthography and morphology guidelines.

    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better alignment of automatic annotations with the gold standard; MADAMIRA-EGY outperforms MADAMIRA-MSA by 4â€“13% absolute on evaluated metrics, indicating MADAMIRA-EGY is a better baseline for Gulf Arabic. Lower OOV rate indicates better vocabulary coverage (MADAMIRA-EGY OOV 5.6% vs MADAMIRA-MSA OOV 9.3%).",
