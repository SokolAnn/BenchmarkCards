    "name": "Yankari: Monolingual Yoruba Dataset",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper presents Yankari, a large-scale monolingual dataset for the Yoruba language, aimed at addressing the critical gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for this important West African language. Yankari comprises 51,407 documents from 13 diverse sources, totaling over 30 million tokens. This dataset provides a foundation for developing more accurate NLP models, supporting comparative linguistic studies, and contributing to the digital accessibility of the Yoruba language.",
