    "name": "PRECOG (Performance forecasting from text descriptions)",
    "abbreviation": "PRECOG",
    "overview": "PRECOG is a corpus of redacted description–performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. It aims to estimate a model's score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, supporting systematic evaluation of LLM performance before running experiments.",

      "Mean Absolute Error (MAE)",
      "Pearson correlation"
    ],
    "calculation": "Predictions are normalized to a 0–100 scale based on reports from scientific literature.",
    "interpretation": "MAE measures absolute accuracy across heterogeneous metrics, while Pearson correlation assesses whether predictions preserve the relative ordering of tasks/configurations.",
    "baseline_results": "MAE of 14.0 achieved with GPT-5 with search retrieval.",
    "validation": "The method is validated through calibration tests and comparison with human predictions."
