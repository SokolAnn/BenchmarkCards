    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manual annotation by 10 annotators recruited via Upwork (5 annotators for section-level labels and 5 annotators for chapter-level labels). Annotators were trained; annotators select paragraph boundaries and keyphrases. Silver labels for domain-specific phrase detection are automatically constructed using a pre-trained domain discriminator."
