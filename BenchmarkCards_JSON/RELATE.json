    "abbreviation": "RELATE",
    "overview": "RELATE is a three-stage pipeline for mapping LLM-extracted biomedical relations to standardized ontology predicates using ChemProt and the Biolink Model. It aims to enhance relation extraction by transforming free-text outputs into structured, ontology-constrained representations.",
