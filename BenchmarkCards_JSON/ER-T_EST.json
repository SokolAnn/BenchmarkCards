    "name": "ER-T EST",
    "abbreviation": "ER-T EST",
    "overview": "ER-T EST is a framework for evaluating explanation regularization (ER) models' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization along three dimensions: unseen dataset tests, contrast set tests, and functional tests. It is designed to analyze how ER design choices (rationale extractor, alignment criterion, human rationale type, instance selection, annotation time) affect ID and OOD performance.",

    "goal": "To provide a unified evaluation framework (ER-T EST) for measuring how explanation regularization methods affect language models' out-of-distribution generalization via: (A) unseen dataset tests, (B) contrast set tests, and (C) functional tests.",

    "limitations": "Contrast set tests and functional tests are generally expensive to create and not many tasks have pre-constructed tests available. Certain tests in ER-T EST may not be applicable to all NLP tasks (e.g., constructing contrast sets for token classification is not straightforward). ER-T EST covers a limited region in the space of OOD evaluation.",

      "Token classification tasks (e.g., Named Entity Recognition) — constructing contrast set tests for token classification is not straightforward, which limits applicability to sequence classification tasks."

      "False Positive Rate Difference (FPRD) for fairness",
      "Mean and standard deviation over seeds"
    ],
    "calculation": "Unseen dataset tests: use each dataset's standard metric (sentiment analysis: Accuracy; NLI: Macro F1). Contrast set tests: contrast consistency = percentage of instances for which both the original instance and all of its contrast instances are predicted correctly. Functional tests: failure rate = percentage of instances predicted incorrectly; normalized failure rate = min-max scaling per functional test, aggregate = mean normalized failure rate across functional tests. Statistical significance: unpaired Welch's t-test between each ER model and No-ER baseline (alternative hypothesis: ER model mean > No-ER mean), p < 0.05.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy and Macro F1 indicate better task performance on unseen datasets. Higher contrast consistency is better. Lower failure rate / lower normalized failure rate indicates better performance on functional tests. Significance is assessed via Welch's t-test (p < 0.05). In this work, ER is interpreted as having little impact on in-distribution (ID) performance but can yield large OOD performance gains under certain design choices.",
    "baseline_results": "No-ER baseline results are reported in the paper's tables. Examples from Table 1 (No-ER): SST (seen Acc) = 94.22 (±0.77), Amazon (unseen Acc) = 90.72 (±1.36), Yelp = 92.07 (±2.66), Movies = 89.83 (±6.79); e-SNLI (seen F1) = 76.18 (±1.28), MNLI (unseen F1) = 46.15 (±4.38). The paper compares these No-ER baselines to multiple ER variants across tables.",
    "validation": "Hyperparameters tuned on development sets (seen dataset dev). Report mean over three random seeds and standard deviation. Early stopping based on total development set loss (task loss + ER loss) with patience of 10 epochs. Use unpaired Welch's t-test (p < 0.05) to measure statistical significance of ER improvements over No-ER."
