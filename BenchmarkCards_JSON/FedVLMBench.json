    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "FedVLMBench is the first systematic benchmark for federated fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The benchmark integrates two mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning strategies, five federated learning algorithms, and six multimodal datasets, providing a standardized platform for evaluating federated fine-tuning strategies and task generalization.",
