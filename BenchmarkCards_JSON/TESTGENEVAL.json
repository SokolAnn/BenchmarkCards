    ],
    "calculation": "Coverage measures the proportion of lines executed by the test suite, Mutation Score is the percentage of injected bugs detected by the tests.",
    "interpretation": "Higher values in coverage and mutation scores indicate better model performance in generating effective test suites.",
    "baseline_results": "The best-performing model achieved a coverage of 35.2% with a mutation score of 18.8%.",
    "validation": "Models were evaluated on the benchmark with multiple runs to ensure reliability across different configurations."
