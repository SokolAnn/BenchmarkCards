    "overview": "A publicly available dataset for Document Layout Analysis in the public affairs / legal domain, collected from 24 official Spanish Administration sources. The database provides semi-automatically annotated layout components (images, tables, links, text blocks) and 4 semantic text categories, and includes pre-processed cleaned text for NLP pre-training and domain adaptation. The database comprises 37.9K documents, 441.3K pages, and more than 8M layout labels.",

    "limitations": "Dataset contains only PDF native (digital-born) documents; scanned-image PDFs were filtered out and left out of the scope.

A 10-fold Cross Validation protocol is referenced for reporting mean/std.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy indicates effective discrimination of the defined text categories. Identifier class obtained mean accuracies over 99% in most sources; Body class achieved mean accuracies over 95%; Title class showed lower/subjective performance (mean >84%) due to labeling subjectivity and confusion with Body.",
    "baseline_results": "Per-source Random Forest classifier overall accuracies reported in Table 3 range from 93.37% (Source 16) to 99.93% (Source 20). Identifier class accuracies exceed 99% in most sources; Body class means exceed 95%; Title class mean accuracies around or above 84%, with 19 sources >90%.",
    "validation": "Initial heuristic-labeled documents were validated and corrected by a unique human supervisor to produce validated documents per source. These validated documents were used to train per-source Random Forest classifiers; classifier outputs were iteratively validated/corrected by the human supervisor to expand the validated set. Performance evaluated via per-source train/test splits at document level and cross-validation as described."
