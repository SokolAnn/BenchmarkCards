    "abbreviation": "MedSG-Bench",
    "overview": "MedSG-Bench is the first benchmark tailored for Medical Image Sequences Grounding, comprising eight VQA-style tasks and totaling 9,630 question-answer pairs. It aims to evaluate the grounding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in sequential medical imaging scenarios.",

    ],
    "calculation": "IoU is calculated as the area of overlap between the predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes divided by the area of their union.",
    "interpretation": "Higher IoU and Acc@0.5 scores indicate better model performance in localizing and grounding the medical image sequences.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "The benchmark was validated through evaluations of both general-purpose and medical-domain specialized MLLMs."
