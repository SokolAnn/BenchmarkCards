    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper examines logical preference consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing a universal evaluation framework based on three properties: transitivity, commutativity, and negation invariance. It introduces a data refinement and augmentation technique called REPAIR to enhance logical consistency.",
