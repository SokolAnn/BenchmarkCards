    "abbreviation": "DUMB",
    "overview": "We introduce the Dutch Model Benchmark: DUMB. The benchmark includes a diverse set of datasets for low-, medium- and high-resource tasks (nine tasks, including four newly introduced Dutch datasets). Instead of relying on a mean score across tasks, we propose Relative Error Reduction (RER), which compares the DUMB performance of language models to a strong baseline. Through experiments on 14 pre-trained language models we assess internal consistency of the tasks and identify factors that enable high performance.",

    "limitations": "Explicit limitations stated by the authors: (1) The benchmark does not include every NLP task type (e.g., parsing) and some tasks are simplified to classification tasks; (2) Relative Error Reduction (RER) may not be comparable to aggregate scores of other benchmarks; (3) Baseline model comparisons only contain Transformer-encoder models and no generative language models; (4) The model comparison contains more English than Dutch models, limiting some conclusions about monolingual Dutch models.",
