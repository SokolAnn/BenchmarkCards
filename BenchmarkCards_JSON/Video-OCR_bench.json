    "overview": "This paper introduces Video-OCR bench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate visual LLMs in various video-OCR tasks. It consists of 1,028 videos and 2,961 question-answer pairs, divided into 6 sub-tasks to evaluate modelsâ€™ ability on text recognition, semantic understanding, spatial relation, movement detection, text attribute recognition, and temporal localization.",
