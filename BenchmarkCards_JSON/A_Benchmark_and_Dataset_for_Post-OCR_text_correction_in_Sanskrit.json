    "name": "A Benchmark and Dataset for Post-OCR text correction in Sanskrit",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We release a post-OCR text correction dataset containing around 218,000 sentences (1.5 million words) from 30 different books across multiple domains (e.g., astronomy, medicine, mathematics). We also release multiple strong seq2seq baselines as benchmarks for the task and a 500-image OCR test set with corresponding text for benchmarking OCR systems. Our best-performing baseline (ByT5+SLP1) yields substantial improvements in Word Error Rate and Character Error Rate over the original OCR outputs.",

    "limitations": "Major limitation is mispredictions at the word level: of the mispredicted words by the best model (ByT5-SLP1), 71.17% are not valid Sanskrit words. Pretrained models used are not lexically or morphologically aware, and none of the pretrained models employed used Sanskrit during pretraining. This can challenge downstream tasks that rely on rule-based morphological analysis of words.",
