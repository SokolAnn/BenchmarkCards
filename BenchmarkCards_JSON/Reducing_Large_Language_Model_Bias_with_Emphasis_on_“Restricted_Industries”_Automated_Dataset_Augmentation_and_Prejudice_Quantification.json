    "name": "Reducing Large Language Model Bias with Emphasis on “Restricted Industries”: Automated Dataset Augmentation and Prejudice Quantification",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper proposes a novel, automated mechanism for debiasing large language models through specified dataset augmentation and introduces two new metrics, the mb-index and db-index, to quantify bias specifically within 'restricted industries' where data is limited.",

    "goal": "To reduce bias in large language models through automated dataset augmentation and to offer quantitative measures for bias in datasets and models.",

    ],
    "metrics": [
      "mb-index",
      "db-index"
    ],
    "calculation": "The mb-index is calculated as the perplexity multiplied by the stereotype score divided by the number of data entries. The db-index is obtained by calculating cosine similarity between dataset entries and a comparison dataset containing biased and abusive language.",
    "interpretation": "A lower mb-index and db-index indicate less bias in the model and dataset respectively.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "The methodology is validated through experimental comparison of LLM performance on original vs. augmented datasets."
