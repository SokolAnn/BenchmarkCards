    "name": "Cognitive Linguistic Identity Fusion Score (CLIFS)",
    "abbreviation": "CLIFS",
    "overview": "The CLIFS is a metric that quantifies identity fusion—the psychological merging of an individual's identity with another entity—from natural language text. It utilizes large language models for automated, scalable assessments and has been validated against established measures.",

    "calculation": "Calculated using specified models with hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and MAE.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 scores and lower MAE indicate better model performance in predicting identity fusion and associated risks.",
    "baseline_results": "CLIFS models exhibited a 6-154% improvement over existing methods in classification tasks.",
    "validation": "Validated against human annotations and established scoring scales."
