    "abbreviation": "ELBA-Bench",
    "overview": "ELBA-Bench provides a comprehensive and unified framework for evaluating backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) through parameter efficient fine-tuning or without fine-tuning strategies. It incorporates over 1300 experiments, 12 attack methods, 18 datasets, and 12 LLMs, providing insights into attack performance and metrics.",
