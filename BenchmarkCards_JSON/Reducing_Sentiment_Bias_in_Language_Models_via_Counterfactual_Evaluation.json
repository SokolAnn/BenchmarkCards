    "name": "Reducing Sentiment Bias in Language Models via Counterfactual Evaluation",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "Quantify and reduce sentiment bias in language models by performing counterfactual evaluation: measuring how the sentiment distribution of generated text changes when sensitive attribute values (e.g., country names, occupations, genders, person names) in the conditioning context are changed, and proposing regularization methods to reduce such bias while retaining comparable perplexity and semantic similarity.",

    "limitations": "Employing specific templates for model evaluation can lack context-sensitivity and such evaluation is necessarily limited and not comprehensive. The sentiment classiﬁer used as a proxy might not be perfect and might exhibit some biases. There exists a trade-off between fairness and semantic relevance (strong regularization can reduce semantic relevance).",

Sentiment-classifier training subsets: 28,957,245 sentences for WMT-19 and 369,594 sentences for WikiText-103 (absolute sentiment score > 0.7 by Google Cloud API).

Individual fairness (I.F.) is the average W1 between PS(x_m) and PS(~x_m) across templates and unordered pairs of sensitive attribute values (Eq.3). Group fairness (G.F.) is the average W1 between subgroup sentiment distribution P_a_S and overall evaluation distribution P̄_S (Eq.4). Perplexity reported on full test set and subset containing sensitive tokens (PPL and PPLs). Semantic similarity computed as cosine similarity between prefix and generated continuation embeddings using the Universal Sentence Encoder; above-threshold fraction defines S.S.; S.S.c is fraction mentioning sensitive token.",
    "interpretation": "Lower I.F. and G.F. (Wasserstein-1) indicate less counterfactual sentiment bias. Lower Perplexity (PPL, PPLs) indicates better language model performance. Higher Semantic Similarity (S.S., S.S.c) indicates generated continuations are more semantically relevant to the prefix. Higher Spearman's correlation values indicate stronger agreement between automatic metrics and human judgments. The paper reports a trade-off: stronger fairness regularization tends to reduce I.F./G.F. but can decrease semantic relevance.",

(Figures and tables provide baseline I.F. and G.F. values and detailed comparisons.)",
    "validation": "Model selection based on validation losses and validation perplexity; sentiment projection classifier trained on high-magnitude Google Cloud sentiment API labeled subset and reported accuracies of 98.8% (WMT-19 subset) and 98.7% (WikiText-103 subset). Multiple sentiment classifiers used to mitigate reliance on a single classifier. Human evaluation (19 annotators, 2 annotations per sentence) used to validate automatic sentiment and semantic similarity metrics; reported Spearman's correlations between automatic sentiment scores and human judgments: 0.75 (Google Cloud), 0.79 (BERT-based), 0.67 (opinion-word based). Spearman's correlations for semantic similarity: 0.72 (S.S.) and 0.63 (S.S.c)."
