    "goal": "To evaluate and improve LLMs as emotional supporters for queer youth by (1) developing a ten-question evaluation questionnaire, (2) constructing the LGBTeen dataset of Reddit posts, human comments and LLM responses, (3) evaluating multiple SOTA LLMs and human baselines, and (4) proposing methods (prompts and a blueprint) to improve reliability, empathy, and personalization.",

  "data": {
    "source": "1,000 posts collected from the r/LGBTeens Reddit forum; for each post the most-upvoted human Reddit comment was collected as a human baseline; responses were generated from multiple LLMs (UI: ChatGPT, BARD; API/open models: GPT3.5, GPT4, Orca v2 7b/13b, Mistral-7b, NeuralChat) using multiple prompts (No prompt, Queer Supporter, Guided Supporter, Redditor, Therapist).",
    "size": "1,000 posts; 11,320 responses in total across models and prompts; human-annotated subset: 80 posts with 4 UI responses each (320 responses) and over 5,000 human-provided labels.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Human annotation using a ten-question questionnaire (answers: 'Yes', 'Partially', 'No', 'Irrelevant') provided by trained evaluators (two females and one male, all identifying as queers, one-hour training, compensated); automatic annotation using GPT3.5 and GPT4 (JSON output format following the annotation guidelines)."

    ],
    "calculation": "Questionnaire answers are converted to weighted scores (0 for 'Irrelevant' and 'No', 0.5 for 'Partially', 1 for 'Yes') and averaged per question; inter-annotator agreement reported as pairwise agreement percentages and Fleiss's κ; diversity computed as average cosine similarity over the K most similar instances using RoBERTa SentenceTransformer embeddings; BLEU scores computed between responses; bootstrap (1,000 iterations) sampling subsets of 35 posts used to measure pairwise model comparison agreement and Spearman correlation.",
    "interpretation": "Higher weighted questionnaire scores (closer to 1) indicate better performance on the evaluated trait; higher Accuracy and Fleiss's κ indicate stronger LLM-human agreement or human IAA; lower cosine similarity and lower BLEU indicate greater diversity (less generic/templated responses); higher Spearman correlation and higher proportion of correct pairwise comparisons indicate agreement between automatic and human rankings. Table 2 notation: ↑ is better for questionnaire-weighted scores; in diversity plots ↓ is better (indicating higher diversity).",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline (most-upvoted Reddit comment) weighted scores (Q1-Q10): Q1 0.98, Q2 0.37, Q3 0.34, Q4 0.20, Q5 0.11, Q6 0.08, Q7 0.07, Q8 0.55, Q9 0.97, Q10 0.23",
    "validation": "Validated via human annotation (80 posts, multiple evaluators, >5,000 labels) and automatic evaluation (GPT3.5 / GPT4) with comparisons against human majority vote; bootstrapped pairwise comparisons (1,000 iterations) to assess consistency of automatic rankings with human judgments; inter-annotator agreement (pairwise agreement and Fleiss's κ) reported for the human evaluators."
