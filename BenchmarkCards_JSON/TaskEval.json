    "name": "TaskEval: Assessing Difficulty of Code Generation Tasks for Large Language Models",
    "abbreviation": "TaskEval",
    "overview": "This paper introduces TaskEval, a framework for evaluating the characteristics of code generation tasks for large language models (LLMs) using diverse prompts and Item Response Theory (IRT). It highlights the limitations of traditional single-prompt evaluations and provides a more granular assessment of task difficulty and discriminant across multiple benchmarks.",
