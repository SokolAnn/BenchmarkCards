    "abbreviation": "CoFaithfulQA",
    "overview": "CoFaithfulQA is a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate faithfulness in scenarios where internal knowledge conflicts with accurate external evidence. It focuses on realistic scenarios rather than synthetic conflicts.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To enhance contextual faithfulness of large language models through suppression of unfaithfulness-associated feed-forward networks (FFNs) and promote reliance on external evidence.",

    "annotation": "Manual annotation based on model-generated responses with binary faithfulness labels."

    "metrics": [
      "Context Recall (ConR)",
      "Memory Recall (MemR)",
      "Memorization Ratio (MR)"
    ],
    "calculation": "ConR measures model alignment with external context, while MemR indicates reliance on internal parametric knowledge; MR quantifies the tendency to favor memorized content.",
    "interpretation": "Higher ConR with lower MemR indicates better contextual faithfulness and reduced reliance on internal memory.",
    "baseline_results": "ParamMute consistently outperformed strong baselines on both CoFaithfulQA and the established ConFiQA benchmark.",
    "validation": "Extensive experiments conducted on CoFaithfulQA and ConFiQA demonstrate the framework's effectiveness."
