    "abbreviation": "IMPLIRET",
    "overview": "IMPLIRET introduces a benchmark for evaluating retrieval models when relevance depends on document-side reasoning on implicit facts. It focuses on reasoning categories such as world knowledge, arithmetic, and temporal.",

    "calculation": "Metrics were calculated based on retrieval performance against implicit queries.",
    "interpretation": "Higher nDCG@10 and ROUGE-1 recall indicate better performance in retrieving relevant documents.",
    "baseline_results": "The best nDCG@10 achieved was 14.91% using dense retrieval methods.",
    "validation": "Validation includes sanity checks on fluency and implicit support for the queried facts."
