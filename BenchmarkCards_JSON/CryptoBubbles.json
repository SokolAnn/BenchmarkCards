    "overview": "CryptoBubbles: a novel multi-span identification task for bubble detection and a publicly released dataset comprising tweets, financial data, and speculative bubbles for 400+ cryptocoins over five years. The benchmark is intended for multi-span crypto bubble forecasting and evaluation of models (e.g., hyperbolic sequence-to-sequence models) under standard and zero-shot settings.",

    "goal": "To formulate CryptoBubbles, a multi-span crypto bubble forecasting task, publicly release a dataset of crypto-related social media and price data, and provide hyperbolic models (MBHN) for modeling power-law dynamics in social media-driven speculative bubbles.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",

      "Multi-span Extraction"
    ],
    "limitations": "MBHN and the benchmark have limited interpretability (MBHN provides limited interpretability to its outputs). The dataset is heavily skewed; the evaluation set contains new cryptos and spans the COVID-19 period, making CryptoBubbles challenging. Potential for exploitation exists as MBHN could be used to hinder market fairness; authors encourage following regulatory and ethical considerations.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Daily price data (opening, closing, high, low) from CryptoCompare for cryptocoins (1 Mar 2016 to 7 Apr 2021); crypto-related tweets extracted under Twitter's official license via regex ticker queries; zero-shot Reddit posts/comments mined via PushshiftAPI; equities price data from Yahoo Finance and CoinGecko for zero-shot evaluation.",
    "size": "Initial selection: 456 cryptocoins; reported overall No. of Bubbles: 1,869; mined ~2.4 million tweets (Train: 1.15M, Validation: 730K, Test: 561K); date range 1 Mar 2016 to 7 Apr 2021. Appendix reports a final set of 404 cryptos after filtering.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Bubble spans were identified using the PSY model (Phillips et al., 2015b) on closing prices and then reviewed by five experienced financial analysts (Cohen's kappa = 0.93). Reviewers agreed with annotations for 90% of bubbles; majority vote used on disagreements; for 5% all reviewers agreed annotations were incorrect and analysts' proposals were used."
