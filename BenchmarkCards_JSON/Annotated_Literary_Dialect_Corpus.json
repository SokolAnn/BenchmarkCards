    "calculation": "Purity is calculated over the clustering of the full relative token set to gain insight into each modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between synthetic and observed variants.",
    "interpretation": "Models exhibit varying abilities to capture dialect effects, with character-level models generally performing better in distinguishing orthographic variations.",
