    "abbreviation": "OVFact",
    "overview": "OVFact is a method for measuring and improving open-vocabulary factuality in vision-language models (VLMs) that output long, descriptive captions. It combines aspects of both precision and recall to assess factuality without relying on ground-truth human annotations.",
