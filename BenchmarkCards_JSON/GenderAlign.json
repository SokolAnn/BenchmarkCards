    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "GenderAlign is an alignment dataset aimed at mitigating a comprehensive set of gender biases in large language models (LLMs). It consists of 8,000 single-turn dialogues, each paired with 'chosen' and 'rejected' responses, where 'chosen' responses demonstrate lower levels of gender bias and higher quality. The dataset categorizes gender biases into four principal categories: stereotypes, discriminatory language, sexism in occupational and educational institutions, and bias against marginalized genders.",
