    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the type of input field: ROUGE for text fields, exact match for radio/select fields, intersection over union for checkbox fields, and L1 distance for range fields.",
    "interpretation": "Scores are averaged across different field types to assess model performance.",
    "baseline_results": "GPT4 achieved a top score of 41.7%, significantly above random chance but below the maximum achievable performance.",
    "validation": "Evaluation is conducted iteratively, where models interact with web pages and provide responses to input fields."
