    "abbreviation": "LLMLingua-2",
    "overview": "This paper presents LLMLingua-2, a task-agnostic prompt compression method that utilizes a data distillation approach to derive knowledge from an LLM (GPT-4) for better performance in prompt compression. The method produces an extractive text compression dataset and evaluates the effectiveness of the approach across multiple benchmarks.",
