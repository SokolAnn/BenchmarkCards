    "name": "SARD (Large-Scale Synthetic Arabic OCR Dataset)",
    "abbreviation": "SARD",
    "overview": "SARD is a massive, synthetically generated dataset specifically designed to simulate book-style documents, comprising 843,622 document images containing 690 million words, rendered across ten distinct Arabic fonts to ensure broad typographic coverage. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating robust OCR and vision-language models capable of processing diverse Arabic book-style texts.",

    "calculation": "Performance metrics are calculated by comparing the recognized text from OCR models to the ground truth text.",
    "interpretation": "Lower CER and WER values signify better accuracy at the character and word levels, respectively. A higher BLEU score indicates greater similarity between predicted and ground truth text.",
    "baseline_results": "Initial benchmark results include various models tested on the dataset, showing a range of performance metrics.",
    "validation": "Validation is achieved through performance evaluations against multiple OCR models using the dataset."
