    "name": "MedExQA (Medical Question Answering Benchmark with Multiple Explanations)",
    "abbreviation": "MedExQA",
    "overview": "This paper introduces MedExQA, a novel benchmark in medical question-answering, to evaluate large language modelsâ€™ (LLMs) understanding of medical knowledge through explanations. By constructing datasets across five distinct medical specialties that are underrepresented in current datasets and further incorporating multiple explanations for each question-answer pair, it addresses a major gap in current medical QA benchmarks.",
