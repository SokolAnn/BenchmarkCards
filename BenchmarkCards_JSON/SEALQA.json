    "overview": "SEALQA is a benchmark for evaluating Search-Augmented Language Models on challenging factual questions where web search results may be conflicting, noisy, or irrelevant. It includes three variants: SEAL-0, SEAL-HARD, and LONG SEAL, each targeting different challenges in search-augmented reasoning.",
