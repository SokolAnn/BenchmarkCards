    "name": "Sequential-NIAH: A Needle-In-A-Haystack Benchmark for Extracting Sequential Needles from Long Contexts",
    "abbreviation": "Sequential-NIAH",
    "overview": "The Sequential-NIAH benchmark is designed to evaluate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to extract sequential information items, known as needles, from long contexts. It includes three needle generation pipelines: synthetic-temporal, real-temporal, and real-logical orders, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K, comprising 14,000 samples.",
