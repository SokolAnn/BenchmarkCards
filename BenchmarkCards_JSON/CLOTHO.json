    "name": "CLOTHO (Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs)",
    "abbreviation": "CLOTHO",
    "overview": "CLOTHO is a task-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty directly from hidden LLM states and ranks inputs by their likelihood of failure to improve task-specific LLM testing.",
    "data_type": "input-output pairs",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "The primary objective of CLOTHO is to improve task-specific LLM testing by prioritizing which inputs to run and label first, ideally exposing failures earlier and with less effort.",

      "ROC-AUC",
      "Spearman Rank Correlation"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the likelihood of passing inputs in relation to the reference distribution derived from hidden states.",
    "interpretation": "A higher ROC-AUC score indicates better performance in failure prediction and test input prioritization.",
    "baseline_results": "Tests were compared against existing pre-generation and post-generation metrics.",
    "validation": "Validation of CLOTHO was performed across eight benchmark tasks."
