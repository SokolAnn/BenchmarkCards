    "name": "Understanding Pun with Image Explanations (UNPIE)",
    "abbreviation": "UNPIE",
    "overview": "UNPIE is a novel benchmark designed to assess the impact of multimodal inputs in resolving lexical ambiguities, specifically using text-based puns paired with illustrative images. It includes three multimodal challenges: Pun Grounding, Pun Disambiguation, and Pun Reconstruction.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To assess machinesâ€™ capacity to actively integrate information from visual sources to resolve ambiguity in text, using puns as a testing ground.",

    "tasks": [
      "Pun Grounding",

    "limitations": "The dataset primarily models lexical ambiguities unique to English and may inadvertently perpetuate cultural biases present in the humor.",

  "data": {
    "source": "The data is derived from the SemEval 2017 English pun corpus, enhanced with visual annotations and multilingual translations.",
    "size": "1,000 puns",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "The pun explanations were generated using a text-to-image model and curated by human annotators."

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on exact matches with the ground-truth outputs and semantic similarity using BERTScore.",
    "interpretation": "A higher accuracy indicates better performance in identifying puns and translating them accurately, while BERTScore correlates with human judgments on semantic alignment.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Evaluations were conducted through a combination of machine-based and human assessments."
