    "limitations": "No large hand-annotated treebank of full parse trees was created; dataset focuses on verification/correction of terms originally tagged as verbs rather than full parse tree annotation; ground-truth human-annotated parse trees for patent claims are unavailable.",

    "size": "174,246 POS tag annotations",
    "format": "Plain text lines; each line contains a patent claim segment, the position within the segment of the term, and the POS tag selected by Turkers (dataset distributed as Release1.0.zip).",
    "annotation": "Crowdsourced annotation via Amazon Mechanical Turk with embedded test questions; accepted HITs were curated (software reconciliation and manual repairs) to produce the curated dataset."

Precision and Recall for parse trees: computed over constituents as |Predicted_constituents ∩ True_constituents| / |Predicted_constituents| and |Predicted_constituents ∩ True_constituents| / |True_constituents| respectively (as defined in Equations 2 and 3 in the paper). Classification Error Rate: percentage of misclassified patents in test set.",
    "interpretation": "Lower Percent Error indicates better POS tag correction. Higher Precision, Recall, and F1 indicate parse trees closer to AMT-annotated trees. Lower Classification Error Rate indicates better downstream subject classification performance.",
    "baseline_results": "POS tagging percent error: Stanford POS Tagger 31.18%; Rule-Based Corrector 23.81%; SVM-Based Corrector 9.17% (Table 4). Parse tree constituent F1 (example from Table 5): Stanford Parser F1 69.08% vs Automatic Corrector F1 83.69%. Patent subject classification: using claim dependencies alone error decreased from 5.974% (original dependencies) to 4.695% (improved claim NLP); combining features yields error rates as low as 2.597% in reported experiments (Figure 9).",
    "validation": "POS tagger: one-third of selected AMT data used for training and two-thirds for testing (113,995 words total: 39,097 training, 74,898 testing). Parse tree evaluation: AMT-held-out tags used as surrogate ground truth; three experiments with different train/test splits across campaigns and patents. Classification: patents with target subclass labels between specified dates assigned to train/test sets."
