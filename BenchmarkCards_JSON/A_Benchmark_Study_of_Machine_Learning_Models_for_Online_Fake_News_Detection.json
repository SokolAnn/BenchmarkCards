Combined Corpus: labeled based on source (news collected from known fake news sites labelled fake and trusted news sources labelled real)."

  "methodology": {

      "Model-based evaluation (comparison of 19 models: traditional, deep learning, and pre-trained language models)",

    "calculation": "Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FN + TN + FP). Precision and Recall computed per class (real and fake) and then macro-averaged. F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1 indicates better model performance. The paper reports that pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ELECTRA) outperform traditional and deep learning models; deep learning models outperform traditional models on larger datasets but are prone to overfitting on small datasets; Naive Bayes with n-gram can achieve competitive performance on sufficiently large datasets.",
    "baseline_results": "Key reported results: Naive Bayes (bigram TF-IDF) achieves 93% accuracy on Combined Corpus. Bi-LSTM and C-LSTM achieve 95% accuracy on Combined Corpus. RoBERTa achieves 96% accuracy on Combined Corpus and 98% accuracy on Fake or Real News. BERT achieves 95% on Combined Corpus. DistilBERT 93% on Combined Corpus. ELECTRA 95% on Combined Corpus. ELMo 91% on Combined Corpus. On LIAR, best pre-trained models achieve ~62% accuracy.",
    "validation": "80:20 train-test split used for each dataset. For LIAR and Fake or Real News the split was random. For Combined Corpus, 80% (train) and 20% (test) were taken from each topic to maintain balanced distribution. Early stopping was applied using validation loss (delta set to zero)."
