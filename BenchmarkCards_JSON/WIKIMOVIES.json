    "abbreviation": "WIKIMOVIES",
    "overview": "WIKIMOVIES is a QA dataset in the movie domain that contains raw text alongside a preprocessed KB, designed to be answerable by using either a perfect KB (based on OMDb), Wikipedia pages or an imperfect KB obtained through running an engineered IE pipeline on those pages. It contains ≈100k questions and was constructed to allow measuring the performance of QA systems when the knowledge source is switched from a KB to unstructured documents and to analyze performance by question type.",

    "goal": "To provide an analysis tool to measure and compare QA system performance when the knowledge source is switched between a human-annotated KB, an automatically extracted KB (IE), and raw Wikipedia documents; and to provide ample training examples and the ability to break down results by question type.",

    "source": "Documents: Wikipedia articles for movies identified by title match to OMDb; KB: triples constructed from OMDb and MovieLens metadata; IE: triples produced by running automatic information extraction including Stanford CoreNLP coreference resolution and SENNA semantic role labeling on Wikipedia pages. Question templates were derived from SimpleQuestions and entities substituted from the KB.",
    "size": "Approximately 100,000 question-answer pairs total; split into ≈96,000 training, 10,000 development, and 10,000 test examples; ≈17,000 Wikipedia documents (movies); KB contains ≈43,000 entities, ≈10,000 related actors, ≈6,000 directors.",

    "interpretation": "Higher Hits@1 (percentage) indicates better top-answer accuracy. Higher MAP and MRR indicate better ranked-answer performance.",

    "validation": "Questions split into disjoint training, development and test sets (≈96k / 10k / 10k). Hyperparameters and memory representations were optimized on the development set. For WIKIQA, word vectors were pre-trained and dropout and exact-match features tuned on the development set."
