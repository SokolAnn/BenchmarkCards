    "overview": "This work formally formulated the Bargaining task for LLM agents and collected a dataset for the Bargaining task, AmazonHistoryPrice, based on Amazonâ€™s price history. This benchmark helps evaluate the bargaining abilities of various LLMs, focusing on the performance of buyers and sellers in different bargaining scenarios.",
