    "abbreviation": "GAOKAO-MM",
    "overview": "GAOKAO-MM is a multimodal benchmark based on the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO), comprising 646 questions across 8 subjects and featuring diverse images. It evaluates large vision-language models (LVLMs) on human-level capabilities including perception, understanding, knowledge, and reasoning, presenting a significant challenge as none of the tested models achieved over 50% accuracy.",
