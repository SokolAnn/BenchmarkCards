    "overview": "MVTamperBench is a benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLM robustness against five prevalent tampering techniques: rotation, masking, substitution, repetition, and dropping; based on real-world visual tampering scenarios. It comprises 3.4K original videos, expanded into over 17K tampered clips covering 19 distinct video manipulation tasks.",
