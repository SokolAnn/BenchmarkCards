    "name": "EMBER (Epistemic Marker Benchmark for Evaluator Robustness)",
    "abbreviation": "EMBER",
    "overview": "EMBER is a benchmark designed to assess the robustness of LLM-judges to epistemic markers in both single and pairwise evaluation settings, focusing on how these markers influence the judging performance of LLMs.",
    "data_type": "question-answering pairs, instruction-following pairs",
    "domains": [
      "Natural Language Processing"
    ],
    "languages": [
      "English"

    "resources": [

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To evaluate the robustness of LLM-judges against epistemic markers and assess how these markers affect their judgment on model-generated outputs.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Model Developers",
      "Domain Experts"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Question Answering",
      "Instruction Following"
    ],
    "limitations": "The study focuses on two specific evaluation tasks, leaving other potential influences of epistemic markers across various tasks unexplored.",
    "out_of_scope_uses": []
  },
  "data": {
    "source": "The EVOUNA dataset (Wang et al., 2024) for question-answering and MIXINSTRUCT (Jiang et al., 2023) for instruction-following.",
    "size": "2,000 instances for EMBER QA and 823 instances for EMBER IF",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "Manually annotated by human evaluators after augmentation with epistemic markers."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics",
      "Human evaluation"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy",
      "Verdict Switch Rate (VSR)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is defined as the match rate between LLM-judges and ground-truth labels. VSR indicates the percentage of samples that changed verdicts due to the presence of epistemic markers.",
    "interpretation": "Ideally, a robust LLM-judge should demonstrate zero changes in verdicts due to epistemic markers.",
    "baseline_results": "Results from five LLM-judges (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Llama-3-70B-Instruct) indicate biases against epistemic markers, particularly weakeners, affecting evaluation accuracy.",
    "validation": "Human evaluators assessed the correctness of model outputs augmented with epistemic markers to ensure validity."
