    "goal": "To assess the effectiveness of RestGPT in processing complex user instructions through RESTful APIs by providing a human-annotated benchmark comprising two realistic scenarios.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Two real-world scenarios: TMDB (movie database) and Spotify (music player). For these scenarios the authors filtered out 54 and 40 commonly used APIs respectively and obtained the corresponding OpenAPI Specifications; instructions and gold API solution paths were collected and annotated by experts.",
    "size": "Test set: 100 instructions for TMDB and 57 instructions for Spotify; Development set: 10 instruction-solution pairs per scenario (20 total); Total test examples: 157; Total dev examples: 20.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manual annotation by 6 experts who brainstormed instructions and annotated gold API solution paths; two additional experts verified solvability and correctness."

      "Automated metrics (Correct Path Rate, Success Rate, ∆Solution Len.)",

    "metrics": [
      "Correct Path Rate",
      "Success Rate",
      "∆Solution Len.",
      "Number of API calls"
    ],
    "calculation": "Correct Path Rate: model-generated API call path is considered correct if it contains the gold API call path as a subsequence (elements not necessarily contiguous). Success Rate: determined by human evaluation of whether the model result successfully fulfills the user query. ∆Solution Len. = (1/Ns) * sum_{i=0..Ns-1} (Li_real - Li_gold) * I(i,success), where Ns is number of successfully accomplished instructions, Li_real and Li_gold are actual and gold number of API calls for the i-th instruction, and I(i,success) indicates successful completion.",
    "interpretation": "A higher Correct Path Rate and higher Success Rate indicate better performance at planning and fulfilling instructions. A smaller ∆Solution Len. indicates better planning efficiency (fewer additional API calls required).",
    "baseline_results": "Reported results (excerpt from Table 4): RestGPT (text-davinci-003): TMDB Success 75.0%, Correct Path 79.0%, ∆Solution Len. +0.55; Spotify Success 72.7%, Correct Path 74.5%, ∆Solution Len. +0.25. Baselines: Offline: TMDB Success 29.0%, CP 33.0%, ∆+1.52; DEPS: TMDB 38.0%/43.0%/+1.20; ReAct: TMDB 44.0%/57.0%/+0.76; Reflexion: TMDB 52.0%/59.0%/+1.37. Ablations: RestGPT w/o Planner: TMDB Success 44.0%, CP 57.0%; w/o Parser: TMDB Success 46.0%, CP 53.0%. Additional model variants and numbers are reported in Table 4 of the paper.",
    "validation": "Annotation verification by two additional experts to ensure solvability and correctness of solution paths; human evaluation used to determine Success Rate; gold API solution paths used as ground truth for Correct Path Rate."
