    "overview": "SwarmBench is a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of large language models (LLMs) acting as decentralized agents in multi-agent systems. It features five foundational coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input and communication.",
