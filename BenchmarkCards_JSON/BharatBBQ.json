    "goal": "The primary objective of BharatBBQ is to evaluate the presence of biases in multilingual language models, specifically in the Indian context, and to make these evaluations culturally relevant.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Bias scores and accuracy are computed based on the responses provided by language models to ambiguous and disambiguated contexts in the dataset.",
    "interpretation": "Higher bias scores indicate a stronger preference for stereotyped responses, while accuracy reflects the model's capability to handle questions that require contextual understanding.",
