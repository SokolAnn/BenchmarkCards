    "name": "A New Pipeline For Generating Instruction Dataset via RAG and Self Fine-tuning",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This research proposes a pipeline that leverages the power of LLMs and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) related framework to construct high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning on specific domains using custom document collections. The approach addresses the challenge of data scarcity by enabling the generation of instruction datasets from a limited set of initial documents.",
