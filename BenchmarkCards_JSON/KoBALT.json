    "name": "KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks)",
    "abbreviation": "KoBALT",
    "overview": "KoBALT is designed to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean by addressing the limitations of conventional benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It comprises 700 linguistically-motivated multiple-choice questions covering 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology.",
