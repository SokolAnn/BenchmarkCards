    "overview": "MM-GCoT is a dataset designed to alleviate visual hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by enhancing their visual-spatial reasoning capabilities through a new learning task termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). It contains training examples for teaching models to ground their reasoning steps with visual evidence.",
