    "name": "BBQ: A Hand-Built Bias Benchmark for Question Answering",
    "overview": "BBQ is a dataset of question sets that highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts. It evaluates model responses in terms of how strongly they reflect social biases and under what contexts these biases override correct answers.",
