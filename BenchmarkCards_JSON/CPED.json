    "name": "CPED: A Large-Scale Chinese Personalized and Emotional Dialogue Dataset for Conversational AI",
    "abbreviation": "CPED",
    "overview": "We propose CPED, a large-scale Chinese personalized and emotional dialogue dataset, which consists of multi-source knowledge related to empathy and personal characteristic. These knowledge covers gender, Big Five personality traits, 13 emotions, 19 dialogue acts and 10 scenes. CPED contains more than 12K dialogues of 392 speakers from 40 TV shows. We release the textual dataset with audio features and video features according to the copyright claims, privacy issues, terms of service of video platforms. We provide detailed description of the CPED construction process and introduce three tasks for conversational AI, including personality recognition, emotion recognition in conversations as well as personalized and emotional conversation generation.",

Speaker-level annotation: name, gender, age group (children, teenager, young, middle-aged, elderly), Big Five personality traits via Chinese BFI-2 (high/low/unknown). Majority vote used; reannotation for disagreements; ambiguous samples discarded."

    "calculation": "Automatic generation metrics (PPL, BLEU, Distinct-N, Greedy, Embedding Average, BERTScore) computed on test set; PRC and ERC evaluated with Accuracy and Macro-F1. Manual evaluation: three experts rated content consistency, emotion correlation and personification on a 0-2 scale. Dataset split by TV series (7:1:2) to avoid speaker overlap.",
    "interpretation": "Higher automatic metric scores (e.g., lower PPL, higher BLEU/DISTINCT/BERTScore) indicate better generation quality; higher Accuracy and Macro-F1 indicate better recognition performance. Manual scores (0-2) measure content consistency, emotional relevance and personification; Fleiss' kappa reported to indicate inter-rater agreement. Paper reports that explicit infusion of emotions and personalities improves personification and emotional expression in generated responses; specific baseline findings are reported per task.",
    "baseline_results": "Reported baselines: PRC (Personality Recognition) evaluated with BERT-based methods (variants BERTs, BERTc, BERTc_senet, BERTc_ssenet) with BERTc_ssenet achieving best Macro-F1/average accuracy among reported PRC baselines. ERC (Emotion Recognition) baselines include utterance-level (TextCNN, TextRNN, TextRCNN, FastText, BERT) and dialogue-level (bcLSTM, DialogueRNN, DialogueGCN, DialogXL, EmoBERTa); BERT+AVG+MLP achieves best average accuracy and Macro-F1 among reported ERC baselines. PEC (Personalized and Emotional Conversation) baselines include Seq2Seq, Transformer, GPT, implicit embedding method (femo+da g-GPT) and explicit fusion methods (GPT-fper/emo/da variants); explicit fusion (e.g., GPT-fper+emo+da_g) yields improved automatic and manual personification and emotion correlation metrics as reported in Table VIII.",
    "validation": "Quality control: three psychology experts with prelabeling rounds and labeling rules; each utterance annotated by 3 experts and majority rule used; inconsistent samples reannotated or discarded. Dataset split by TV series (7:1:2) to avoid speaker overlap between splits."
