    "overview": "MedRepBench is a comprehensive benchmark built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports to evaluate end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) for structured medical report understanding. It includes an objective evaluation measuring field-level recall of structured clinical items and an automated subjective evaluation using a large language model to assess factuality, interpretability, and reasoning quality.",
