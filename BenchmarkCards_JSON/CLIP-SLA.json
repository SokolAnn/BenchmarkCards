    "name": "CLIP-SLA (CLIP Sign Language Adaptation)",
    "abbreviation": "CLIP-SLA",
    "overview": "CLIP-SLA is a framework that leverages the powerful pre-trained visual encoder from the CLIP model for continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. It introduces two variants, SLA-Adapter and SLA-LoRA, which integrate PEFT modules into the CLIP visual encoder for efficient sign language tasks.",
