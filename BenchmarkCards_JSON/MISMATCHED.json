    "name": "MISMATCHED Benchmark for Scientific Natural Language Inference",
    "abbreviation": "MISMATCHED",
    "overview": "The MISMATCHED benchmark introduces a new evaluation framework for scientific natural language inference (NLI) by covering non-computer science domains. It includes human annotated sentence pairs from psychology, engineering, and public health, serving as an out-of-domain test bed.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To provide a challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of scientific NLI models across non-CS domains.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Domain Experts"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Natural Language Inference"
    ],
    "limitations": "Although the MISMATCHED benchmark enhances diversity in scientific NLI, many scientific domains (e.g., Physics, Chemistry) are not covered.",

      "Human evaluation",
      "Automated metrics"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Macro F1"
    ],
    "calculation": "Macro F1 calculated based on the performance across all classes in the benchmark.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Macro F1 indicates better performance in correctly identifying the semantic relationships.",
    "baseline_results": "Best performing SLM baseline (SCIBERT) achieved a Macro F1 of 78.17%.",
    "validation": "The benchmark was validated through human annotations for ensuring quality and consistency."
