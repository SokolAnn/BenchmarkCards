    "overview": "Re-purpose a publicly available archived dataset of more than 9.4 billion Tweets with the objective of creating a very large dataset of drug usage-related tweets; provide a publicly available dataset of 1,181,993 tweet ids and code/procedure to extract these tweets for researchers to use in Pharmacovigilance research.",

    "goal": "Create a very large dataset of drug usage-related tweets to help train machine learning and deep learning models for Pharmacovigilance and drug safety research, and to provide code and tweet ids for reproducible extraction.",

    "limitations": "Only English tweets are used; no spelling correction module was employed (eliminating tweets with incorrect drug spellings); annotated training tweets were collected from publicly available sources (no new manual annotation was performed) and edge cases/ambiguous tweets were not considered.",

    "format": "List of Tweet IDs (text); tweet text is NOT shared due to Twitter's terms of service",

    "methods": [
      "Classical machine learning classification (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree)",

    "calculation": "Metrics (precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy) were calculated on a stratified 75-25% (training-test) split of the annotated training set. Validation experiments used external annotated test sets (7,414 drug tweets and 7,414 non-drug tweets = 14,828 test tweets). Probability cutoffs for selecting tweets were determined by fitting a mixture of two Gaussians to model probability scores and selecting the deepest valley between peaks as threshold.",
    "interpretation": "SVM was selected as the best model based on F-measure and Accuracy. High precision/recall/accuracy in validation experiments are presented as evidence that the dataset can be used to train models for Pharmacovigilance.",
    "baseline_results": "Classical models (Table 6) on stratified 75-25% split: SVM — Precision 0.7773, Recall 0.8091, F-measure 0.7929, Accuracy 0.8456. Validation experiments (Table 8) — Experiment 1 best model SVM: Precision 0.9964, Recall 0.8331, F-measure 0.9075, Accuracy 0.9150; Experiment 2 best model SVM: Precision 0.9982, Recall 0.8369, F-measure 0.9104, Accuracy 0.9177.",
    "validation": "Two bimodal classification validation experiments using classical machine learning models. Table 7 reports: Experiment 1 — Train data: 2,000,000 tweets; Test data: 14,828 tweets. Experiment 2 — Train data: 134,063,321 tweets; Test data: 14,828 tweets. The test set consists of 7,414 annotated drug tweets and 7,414 annotated non-drug tweets obtained from publicly available resources."
