    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We propose a novel method for comparing the fluency of multilingual models to monolingual models by testing preference for two carefully-chosen variable grammatical structures (optional pronoun-drop in Spanish and optional Subject-Verb ordering in Greek). We use this method to show that multilingual BERT is biased toward English-like sentence structure in Spanish and Greek compared to monolingual controls.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To introduce a fluency evaluation method that detects English structural bias in multilingual models by comparing model preferences for Sparallel (English-like structure) versus Sdifferent (non-English-like structure) and to demonstrate this effect in Spanish (pro-drop) and Greek (subject-verb order).",

    "limitations": "Does not focus on truly low-resource languages because the method requires an available monolingual model as a control; experiments focus on BERT-sized models and may not extrapolate to larger models; constructions tested are discourse-dependent but experiments use isolated sentences without discourse context.",
