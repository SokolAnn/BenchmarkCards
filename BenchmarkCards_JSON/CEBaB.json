    "abbreviation": "CEBaB",
    "overview": "We introduce CEBaB, a new benchmark dataset for assessing concept-based explanation methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP). CEBaB consists of short restaurant reviews with human-generated counterfactual reviews in which an aspect (food, noise, ambiance, service) of the dining experience was modified. Original and counterfactual reviews are annotated with multiply-validated sentiment ratings at the aspect-level and review-level.",

      "Empirical Individual Treatment Effect (dITE) and Empirical Average Treatment Effect (dATE)",
      "Accuracy",
      "Macro-F1"
    ],
    "calculation": "ICaCE-Error is the average distance between the empirical individual causal concept effect \\ICaCE (computed as N(ϕ(x_{C=c0,u})) - N(ϕ(x_{C=c,u}))) and the explainer's predicted effect ENϕ(x_{C=c,u};c0), averaged over edit pairs. Distances used are Cosine, L2 (Euclidean), and NormDiff (absolute difference between Euclidean norms). \\CaCE is aggregated average of \\ICaCE over matching edit pairs. dITE and dATE use dataset labels to compute empirical treatment effects.",
    "interpretation": "Lower ICaCE-Error indicates an explanation method better approximates the true individual causal concept effect. Cosine distance measures agreement in direction (ignores magnitude), L2 measures both direction and magnitude, and NormDiff measures magnitude only.",
    "baseline_results": "A simple Approximate Counterfactual baseline (sampling an original review with matching aspect labels as an approximate counterfactual) outperforms most evaluated methods on ICaCE-Error. INLP and S-Learner achieve state-of-the-art on some metrics. For a bert-base-uncased five-way sentiment classifier, reported \\CaCE (average change in classifier output) values include: food (Negative→Positive) = 1.90 (±0.03), service (Negative→Positive) = 1.42 (±0.04), ambiance (Negative→Positive) = 1.27 (±0.01), noise (Negative→Positive) = 0.75 (±0.02). Results are averaged over 5 seeds (see paper tables for full numeric results).",
    "validation": "Dataset released with fixed train/dev/test splits enforcing grouped constraint (all edits related to an original review occur in the same split) and a rule that any group with a 'no majority' label is placed in the train set. Two train variants: inclusive (11,728 texts) and exclusive (1,755 examples). 99% of aspect-level edits have a majority label matching the editing goal; 88% of texts have a review-level majority label. Models' results on standard classification tasks (reported in Appendix) demonstrate dataset reliability."
