    "name": "LocateBench",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "LocateBench is a high-quality benchmark dedicated to evaluating the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to locate objects in an image according to natural language instructions. It consists of a multiple choice question dataset where VLMs must select the correct bounding box from four candidates based on the provided questions.",

    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is calculated based on the correct identification of the bounding box by VLMs from the provided options.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better model performance in locating objects as instructed by natural language.",
    "baseline_results": "Human accuracy: 95%. GPT-4o accuracy: significantly lower than human performance.",
    "validation": "Rigorous validation process involving manual inspection and correction of examples by authors."
