    "name": "An extended benchmark",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "The paper formalizes benchmarking when some system scores are missing on tasks and proposes a novel approach that uses compatible partial rankings to impute missing data, aggregated using the Borda count. It provides two refinements for task-level and instance-level scores and introduces an extended benchmark containing over 131 million scores. Code and data are shared at https://github.com/AnasHimmi/MissingDataRanking.",

Confidence intervals computed via Hoeffding inequality: cij = sqrt(-log(ε) / (2 zij)), where zij is the number of comparisons.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Kendall τ (closer to 1) indicates robustness of the aggregation to missing data. If 0.5 is not in the pairwise confidence interval [cM_ij - cij, cM_ij + cij], the ordering between systems i and j is considered statistically significant with high probability.",

    "validation": "Validated on synthetic experiments (e.g., N=20 systems, T=20 tasks, K=20 instances; experiments repeated 100 times) and extensive real-data experiments using task-level datasets (GLUE, SGLUE, XTREME, GEM) and instance-level datasets (translation WMT series, summarization TAC and SummEval, image description Flickr/COCO, WebNLG, dialogue PersonaChat/TopicalChat). Robustness assessed by randomly removing a proportion of scores and measuring Kendall τ; confidence interval analysis applied to real benchmarks (example: WMT en-de)."
