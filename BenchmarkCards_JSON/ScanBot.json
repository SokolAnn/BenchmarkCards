    "overview": "ScanBot is the first instruction-conditioned, multimodal dataset designed explicitly for high-precision surface scanning tasks in robotic systems. It targets the shortcomings of existing datasets by providing synchronized multimodal observations, including RGB, depth, and laser profiles, paired with natural language instructions for a variety of scanning tasks.",

    "calculation": "Model performance metrics are calculated based on the accuracy of selected scanner parameters, localization of objects based on instructions, and fidelity of the reconstructed surfaces compared to ground-truth.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy metrics indicate better model performance in generating stable scanning trajectories and precise interpretations of natural language instructions.",
    "baseline_results": "Existing VLA models show poor performance with average accuracies below 50% in selection of parameters and task execution.",
    "validation": "Validation procedures involve comparing model outputs against ground-truth scans captured under controlled conditions."
