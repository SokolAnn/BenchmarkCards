    "calculation": "The ADC is calculated as the second-order moment of negative performance deviation on all evaluation dimensions in the benchmark, focusing on performance reductions across different alignment objectives.",
    "interpretation": "A lower ADC value indicates reduced conflict among alignment objectives, which is desirable for effective preference modeling.",
    "baseline_results": "Compared with existing preference datasets like Anthropic HH and UltraFeedback, Hummer shows improved performance and reduced ADC.",
    "validation": "Validated through performance comparison on standard evaluation metrics across different datasets."
