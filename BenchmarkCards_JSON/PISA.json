    "overview": "This paper introduces a novel prompt-based time series forecasting paradigm (PromptCast) in which numerical input and output are transformed into natural language prompts so language generation models can be applied to forecasting. To support research on this task the authors present a large-scale dataset (PISA) covering three real-world forecasting scenarios and develop a benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art numerical forecasting methods and popular language generation models.",

    "calculation": "Missing Rate is defined as (n_test - n_decoded) / n_test × 100% where n_test is number of test instances and n_decoded is number of generated outputs from which a numerical value can be decoded. RMSE and MAE are computed after extracting predicted numerical values from generated output sentences via string parsing. For deep learning methods results are reported as mean ± standard deviation over five runs with different random seeds.",
    "interpretation": "Lower RMSE and MAE indicate better numerical forecasting accuracy. Lower Missing Rate indicates better ability of language models to generate decodable numeric predictions. Results averaged over five runs; model comparisons are performed using the same chronological train/val/test splits.",
    "baseline_results": "Benchmark includes numerical baselines and language model baselines. Examples from the paper: numerical best (FEDformer fixed) on CT: RMSE 6.358, MAE 4.841 (Table III); Informer fixed on ECL: RMSE 536.921, MAE 349.331 (Table III); language-model best (Bigbird) on CT: RMSE 6.351, MAE 4.707 (Table IV).",
    "validation": "Each subset is split by chronological order into training/validation/test with ratio 7:1:2 (as reported in Table II). For reported deep learning results, averages and standard deviations are computed over five runs with different random seeds. Decoding success is measured via Missing Rate as described."
