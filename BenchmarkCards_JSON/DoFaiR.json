    "abbreviation": "DoFaiR",
    "overview": "DoFaiR is a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in Text-to-Image (T2I) models. It consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances aimed at revealing the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on comparisons between the generated demographic distributions and the ground truth distributions regarding racial and gender traits.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores in DDA, IDA, and IDF indicate better adherence to factual demographic distributions, whereas lower FDD indicates closer alignment to ground truth demographic diversity.",
