    "name": "GLOBAL RG",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "The GLOBAL RG benchmark comprises two tasks: retrieval across universals and cultural visual grounding. The retrieval task entails retrieving culturally diverse images for universal concepts from 50 countries, while the grounding task aims at grounding culture-specific concepts within images from 15 countries.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Images collected from Google Images using human universals and cultural keywords extracted from CANDLE.",
    "size": "3,000 images for retrieval task; 591 images for grounding task.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Annotated by cultural experts who drew bounding boxes around relevant concepts."

      "Precision@k",

      "Intersection over Union (IoU)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Precision measures correctness of retrieved images; diversity uses entropy to measure cultural diversity among retrieved images; IoU assesses correctness of predicted bounding boxes.",
    "interpretation": "Higher precision indicates better retrieval performance; higher diversity denotes a better representation of multiple cultures.",
    "baseline_results": "Performance was reported for several state-of-the-art models, such as CLIP, OpenCLIP, and CoCA.",
    "validation": "Extensive evaluation across multiple vision-language models."
