    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This study examines how textual implicitness affects Information Extraction (IE) tasks in pre-trained LLMs by generating two synthetic datasets of 10k implicit and explicit verbalizations of biographic information. It analyzes whether fine-tuning with implicit data improves LLM performance in extracting information.",
