    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "TimeShift is a novel framework and dataset designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to handle time-sensitive facts, comprising over 8,000 events annotated with day-level granularity from 2018 to 2024, sourced globally across various domains.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To provide a structured framework for testing models' temporal awareness by evaluating their ability to correctly associate events with their respective time periods.",

    "limitations": "The dataset is exclusively in English, which may limit applicability to multilingual LLMs. It primarily focuses on open-source models requiring log probability access for evaluation.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Constructed using a custom web-scraping pipeline from major global news outlets, academic journals, and government publications.",
    "size": "8,000 events",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Automated filtering mechanisms cross-referenced timestamps and removed duplicates, while heuristic-based checks discarded ambiguous events."

    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is evaluated based on the model's probability of correctly predicting the year, month, and day of an event.",
    "interpretation": "A higher accuracy percentage indicates a better performance in associating a given event with its correct temporal context.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Evaluation is performed by measuring log probabilities against known time-sensitive facts."
