    "name": "Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE)",
    "abbreviation": "SLiCE",
    "overview": "The Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE) is a novel metric introduced for automated extraction of schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. It evaluates the structural correctness and semantic fidelity of the extracted lineage, utilizing a benchmark of 1,700 manually annotated schema lineages from real-world scripts.",
