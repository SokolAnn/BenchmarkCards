    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "A platform to compare document and query processing techniques on the TREC Clinical Decision Support 2016 corpus. The system benchmarks indexing and search techniques (e.g., negation detection, normalization, query expansion, use of knowledge bases, learning-to-rank) and reproduces leading teams' runs to enable statistical testing of hypotheses and provide a common baseline for future research.",

    "goal": "To provide a stable platform to formally specify methods, re-run past TREC CDS experiments, compare document and query processing techniques on the CDS'16 corpus, and produce benchmark results to evaluate and rank retrieval methods.",

    "limitations": "Results could not be reproduced exactly due to lack of sufficient details on preprocessing steps, implementation details, and unavailability of older versions of public search engines.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Evaluations use the four CDS track metrics (infNDCG as the main metric, infAP, R-Prec, P@10). Statistical significance of improvements over baseline is tested using a paired two-sample t-test reported at 95% and 98% confidence levels.",
    "interpretation": "infNDCG is treated as the primary effectiveness measure; statistically significant increases in these metrics (per paired t-test at 95%/98% confidence) indicate improvement over baseline methods.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline BM25 (no query expansion or preprocessing): Note infNDCG 0.1074, Desc infNDCG 0.1067, Sum infNDCG 0.1721; P@10 Note 0.1400, Desc 0.1200, Sum 0.2067 (see Table 2).",
    "validation": "Evaluated against TREC CDS relevance judgments (qrels). Learning-to-rank used topics and relevance judgments from TREC CDS 2014 and 2015 as training data. Significance testing via paired two-sample t-test."
