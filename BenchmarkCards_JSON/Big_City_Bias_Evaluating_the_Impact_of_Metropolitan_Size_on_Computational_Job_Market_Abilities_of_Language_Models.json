    "name": "Big City Bias: Evaluating the Impact of Metropolitan Size on Computational Job Market Abilities of Language Models",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper quantifies the metropolitan size bias encoded within large language models by evaluating salary, employer presence, and commute duration predictions in 384 of the United Statesâ€™ metropolitan regions. The results show that smaller regions are underrepresented, with performance disparities evident across models.",
