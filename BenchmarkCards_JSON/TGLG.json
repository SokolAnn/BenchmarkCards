    "abbreviation": "TGLG",
    "overview": "Temporally-Grounded Language Generation (TGLG) is a benchmark task that requires models to generate utterances that are both semantically accurate and precisely timed in response to streaming visual input. It evaluates two core capabilities necessary for real-time environments: perceptual updating and contingency awareness.",
