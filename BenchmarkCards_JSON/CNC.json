    "overview": "CNC is a corpus of news articles annotated with causal information suitable for causal text mining. The paper introduces a shared task with two subtasks: (1) Causal Event Classification and (2) Cause-Effect-Signal Span Detection. Participants uploaded predictions for a held-out test set and ranking was done based on binary F1 for Subtask 1 and macro F1 for Subtask 2.",

Subtask 2 splits: Train: 160 sentences, Dev: 15 sentences, Test: 89 sentences. Subtask 2 relations: Train: 183 relations, Dev: 18 relations, Test: 119 relations, Total 320 relations.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manual annotation by five annotators using the WebAnno tool. Subtask 1: sentences labeled as Causal or Non-causal; majority vote retained as final label and curator breaks ties. Subtask 2: annotators marked Cause, Effect and Signal spans and linked spans; curator consolidated final span annotations (curator decided final selection when no majority). Annotations were checked with Python scripts to identify avoidable human errors."

For Subtask 2, evaluation was at the relation level and code was adjusted to extract the combination of predicted relations that results in the best F1. If number of predicted relations > number of actual relations, only the first n_a predictions were kept; if fewer, missing relations were represented by tokens labeled Other (O).",
    "interpretation": "Models were ranked by F1 performance on the competition test set (binary F1 for Subtask 1, macro F1 for Subtask 2). Higher F1 indicates better performance. Reported top test F1 scores were 86.19% (Subtask 1) and 54.15% (Subtask 2).",

Subtask 2 agreement metrics: Exact Match (EM) = 6.96%, One-Side Bound (OSB) = 23.27%, Token Overlap (TO) = 27.31%, K-Alpha = 46.27%. Competition had a trial period and a test period; validation labels were released on August 01, 2022 for trial use; test submissions on Codalab were limited (each participant allowed 5 submissions for test)."
