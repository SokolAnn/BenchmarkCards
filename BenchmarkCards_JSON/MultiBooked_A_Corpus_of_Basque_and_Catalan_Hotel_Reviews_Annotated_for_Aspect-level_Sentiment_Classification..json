    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We introduce two datasets for supervised aspect-level sentiment analysis in Basque and Catalan, both of which are under-resourced languages. We provide high-quality annotations and benchmarks with the hope that they will be useful to the growing community of researchers working on these languages. The corpus is available at http://hdl.handle.net/10230/33928 or https://jbarnesspain.github.io/resources/ .",

    "source": "Crawled hotel reviews: Catalan reviews from www.booking.com; Basque reviews crawled from a number of websites (authors state a total of 35 different websites including www.airbnb.com, www.atrapalo.com, www.nekatur.net, www.rentalia.es, www.toprural.es, and www.tripadvisor.com). Reviews collected from November 2015 to January 2016. Language identification was used to remove Spanish or mixed reviews and reviews shorter than 7 tokens.",
    "size": "567 reviews (Catalan); 343 reviews (Basque). Number of targets: 2762 (Catalan), 1775 (Basque). Number of expressions: 2346 (Catalan), 2328 (Basque). Number of holders: 236 (Catalan), 296 (Basque). Average length in tokens: 45 (Catalan), 46.9 (Basque).",
    "format": "KAF/NAF (stand-off XML) format",
    "annotation": "Manual annotation following the OpeNER annotation scheme: annotators labeled opinion holders, opinion targets, opinion expressions, and polarity (STRONG NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, POSITIVE, STRONG POSITIVE). Annotation performed using the KafAnnotator tool in a three-phase process with annotator comparison meetings and a third annotator adjudicating conflicts."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Sequence labeling baseline using Conditional Random Field (CRF) on standard sequence-labeling features (word-, subword-, and part-of-speech features)",

    "calculation": "Inter-annotator agreement: agr(a||b) = |A_matching_B| / |A|; AvgAgr(a,b) = 1/2 * (agr(a||b) + agr(b||a)). Polarity MSE: assign integers to labels (Strong Negative: 0, Negative: 1, Positive: 2, Strong Positive: 3) and compute mean squared error per sentence, then average across corpus. Evaluation: weighted F1 score reported for extraction and classification using 10-fold cross-validation.",
    "interpretation": "For AvgAgr, perfect agreement is 1.0 and no agreement is 0.0. Similar annotation projects report AvgAgr scores between 0.6 and 0.8. For polarity MSE, perfect agreement is 0.0; larger MSE indicates larger discrepancies in polarity assignment. Weighted F1 is used to evaluate extraction and classification performance (higher is better).",
    "baseline_results": "Extraction (CRF) weighted F1: Targets 0.64 (Catalan), 0.57 (Basque); Expressions 0.52 (Catalan), 0.54 (Basque); Holders 0.56 (Catalan), 0.54 (Basque). Polarity classification (linear SVM) weighted F1: 0.80 (Catalan), 0.84 (Basque).",
    "validation": "10-fold cross-validation (80% training per fold). Inter-annotator agreement evaluated using AvgAgr for spans (targets, expressions, holders) and MSE for polarity."
