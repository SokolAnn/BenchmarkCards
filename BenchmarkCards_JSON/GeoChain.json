    "name": "GeoChain",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "GeoChain is a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), utilizing 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images paired with a 21-step chain-of-thought question sequence.",

      "Model Developers"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Geographic Reasoning",
      "Visual Question Answering"

  "data": {
    "source": "Mapillary Street-Level Sequences dataset, augmented with semantic segmentation and locatability scores.",
    "size": "1.46 million images, with 30 million question-answer pairs",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Semantic class labeling and human-inspired locatability score for difficulty stratification."

      "Diagnostic evaluation"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Pass Score",
      "Haversine Distance"
    ],
    "calculation": "Pass Score is the average fraction of questions correctly answered across the full 21-step reasoning chain for each image. Haversine Distance measures the shortest distance over the Earthâ€™s surface between predicted and ground-truth coordinates.",
    "interpretation": "A higher Pass Score indicates better performance in answering the question chain correctly. Lower Haversine Distance indicates better localization accuracy.",
    "baseline_results": "Evaluation of leading MLLMs such as GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7, and Gemini 2.5 variants.",
    "validation": "Test-Mini subset of 2088 images manually curated for high quality and challenge."
