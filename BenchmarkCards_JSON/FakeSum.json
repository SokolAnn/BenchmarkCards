    "abbreviation": "FakeSum",
    "overview": "We propose an approach for generating a dataset using adversarial prompting to create a robust fake news dataset that helps in understanding the anatomy of LLM-generated misinformation. This dataset captures various misinformation patterns and exhibits how LLMs can be leveraged for generating misinformation, which lays the groundwork for effectively fighting against it.",
