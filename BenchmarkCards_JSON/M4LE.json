    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on model performance in different context lengths and across abilities, normalized against a baseline model (GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K).",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate better performance in understanding and processing long-context data, with significant drops noted at longer input lengths.",
    "baseline_results": "Performance compared to 11 prominent LLMs, notably observed drops in accuracy correlated with longer contexts, particularly in tasks requiring multiple span attention.",
    "validation": "Systematic evaluation across various models to assess their competencies in handling long inputs."
