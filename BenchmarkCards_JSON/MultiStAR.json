    "name": "MultiStAR (Multi-Stage Abstract Visual Reasoning)",
    "abbreviation": "MultiStAR",
    "overview": "MultiStAR is a benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) during the abstract visual reasoning (AVR) process through two subtasks: Direct Answer and Logical Chain, focusing on intermediate reasoning steps.",
    "data_type": "question-answering pairs",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To assess reasoning across varying levels of complexity in MLLMs while accounting for both intermediate and final answers in abstract visual reasoning tasks.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Model Developers"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Visual Question Answering"
    ],
    "limitations": "The intermediate task generation is restricted to datasets with defined object attributes; limits applicability to other AVR datasets lacking such metadata.",
    "out_of_scope_uses": []
  },
  "data": {
    "source": "Derived from the RA VEN dataset.",
    "size": "8,100 examples for Direct Answer; 560 examples for Logical Chain.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is computed as the proportion of correct answers. MSEval aggregates correctness across all reasoning stages.",
    "interpretation": "MSEval provides a more granular analysis of the modelâ€™s performance, reflecting the correctness of both intermediate steps and final answers.",
    "baseline_results": "Human performance serves as a baseline with ratings exceeding 60% across tasks.",
    "validation": "Evaluated through tests against human performances and model capabilities."
