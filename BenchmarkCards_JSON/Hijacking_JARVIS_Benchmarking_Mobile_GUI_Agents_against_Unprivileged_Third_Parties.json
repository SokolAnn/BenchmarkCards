    "overview": "This paper presents a systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of mobile GUI agents through a benchmark suite that evaluates their robustness against misleading content injected by unprivileged third parties. It introduces AgentHazard, a framework for simulating attack scenarios, and develops a comprehensive suite comprising a dynamic task execution environment and a static dataset.",
