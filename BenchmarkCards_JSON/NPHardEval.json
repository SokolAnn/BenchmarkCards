    "overview": "NPHardEval is a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a broad spectrum of 900 algorithmic questions extending up to the NP-Hard complexity class. The benchmark aims to provide a rigorous and quantitative assessment of LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities, and includes a dynamic updating mechanism to mitigate overfitting.",
