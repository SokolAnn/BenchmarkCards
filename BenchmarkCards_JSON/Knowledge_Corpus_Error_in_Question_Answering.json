    "name": "Knowledge Corpus Error in Question Answering",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This study introduces the concept of knowledge corpus error in open-domain question answering, empirically demonstrating that generated contexts can be more helpful than retrieved contexts from a conventional knowledge corpus. The paper shows that paraphrasing human-annotated gold contexts using large language models can enhance performance across multiple question-answering benchmarks.",
