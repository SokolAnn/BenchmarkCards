    "overview": "LEPISZCZE is a new, comprehensive benchmark for Polish NLP with a large variety of tasks and high-quality operationalization. It concentrates public Polish datasets (existing and new) in specific tasks, provides a continuous-submission leaderboard, supports data versioning and model tracking, and is designed to be easily extendable to add new models, datasets, and tasks.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "Provide an extensive, flexible, and reproducible benchmark for Polish NLP that expands previous Polish benchmark KLEJ with eight new datasets, offers a unified API, supports data versioning and model tracking, and serves as a blueprint for designing benchmarks for other low-resourced languages.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Collection of 13 datasets assembled for the benchmark, including previously incorporated KLEJ datasets and eight new datasets: PAC (Polish Abusive Clauses), AspectEmo (extended PolEmo 2.0), CDSC-E, DiaBiz.Kom (Dialogue Acts), DYK (Did You Know?), KPWr-NER, NKJP-POS, PolEmo 2.0, Political Advertising, PSC (Polish Summaries Corpus), Punctuation Restoration, and Dialogue Acts (WIP). Many datasets originate from CLARIN-PL project authors; datasets and data-loading scripts were uploaded to the HuggingFace Datasets repository.",
    "size": "Dataset sizes vary per dataset. Examples explicitly stated: DiaBiz.Kom: 1,277,962 tokens in 1,104 transcribed conversations; PAC: 4,129 abusive clause examples and 5,127 non-abusive fragments from >700 contracts; AspectEmo: 1,465 reviews; CDSC-E: 1,000 sentence pairs; DYK: 4,721 question-answer pairs; KPWr-NER: 13,959 training and 4,323 test sentences; NKJP-POS: 85,663 sentences; PolEmo 2.0: 8,216 reviews / 57,466 sentences; PSC: 569 summaries; Punctuation Restoration: 36 hours of transcription, 1,000 texts (800 train, 200 test). Table 1 provides full train/dev/test counts per dataset.",
    "format": "Unified HuggingFace Datasets-compatible format (datasets were unified into an accessible and easy-to-process data format and uploaded to HuggingFace Datasets).",
    "annotation": "Primarily human annotation. Examples: DiaBiz.Kom annotated by three linguists in a 2+1 system (reported inter-annotator agreement: Positive Specific Agreement 0.78 for borders and categories and 0.86 for borders); KPWr-NER human annotated using BIO notation; NKJP-POS annotated by humans with 35 tags; AspectEmo annotated at aspect level with six sentiment categories; CDSC-E contains human-annotated entailment labels; PAC dataset creation involved the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection and PII checks with removal of a couple of examples."

      "Precision (macro, micro, weighted)",
      "Recall (macro, micro, weighted)",
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Hyper-parameter search used macro averaged F1 as the objective function and was performed on the validation subset (if validation subset missing, 10% of training subset was randomly sampled). For each dataset-model pair, the best configuration by F1-macro on validation was selected, models were retrained five times, and metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 with different averaging) were calculated on test sets. Experimental environment logged metrics, hyper-parameters, dataset information, and package versions via Weights & Biases and DVC.",
    "interpretation": "Authors state that comparing models between tasks using different metrics may be misleading; they use homogeneous metrics to compare and score models. Macro F1 was used as the optimization objective in hyper-parameter search. Computational costs and environment metadata are tracked to enable leaderboards that incorporate efficiency.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline results for five language models across 13 datasets are reported in Table 3 (macro F1 per dataset and model; mean ranks provided). Example entries: CDSC-E HerBERT (base, cased) macro F1 90.96 Â± 0.73; HerBERT (large) mean rank 1.62. Full per-dataset per-model metrics are presented in Table 3 and expanded metrics in Appendix A.3.",
    "validation": "Hyper-parameter search evaluated on validation subsets (or 10% sampled from training when missing). Best configurations were retrained five times for final evaluation. Experiments tracked with DVC and Weights & Biases. The initial version used original predefined splits; authors plan to evaluate multiple/non-original splits in future versions."
