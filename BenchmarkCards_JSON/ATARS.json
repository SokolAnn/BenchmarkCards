    "name": "Atypical Aspect-based Recommender System (ATARS)",
    "abbreviation": "ATARS",
    "overview": "This paper introduces a new task of engineering serendipity in recommendations by promoting items with atypical aspects that match user interests. It presents an LLM-based system that extracts atypical aspects from reviews, estimates their user-specific utility, and ranks items to enhance user satisfaction through surprise and relevance.",
