    "goal": "To provide a large-scale dataset for the detection and extraction of short (abbreviations) and long forms in scientific documents, and to release baseline models and code for abbreviation detection.",

    "limitations": "Dataset is mainly focused on the Biomedical domain; 26.7% of sampled segments had missing annotation and 5.5% had wrong annotation in a sampled analysis; one-character abbreviations were filtered out which removed 705 unique long forms (3,877 occurrences); some long forms and abbreviations were found to be incorrectly formed and were removed during validation.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Open access articles from PLOS journals (PMC Open Access Subset via NCBI FTP), extracted from XML articles' \"Abbreviations\" sections and <p> text.",
    "size": "Final PLOD Filtered Dataset: 160,932 annotated segments; 449,266 annotated abbreviations; 266,351 annotated long forms. Raw corpus: 305,445 files (31GB); Research Articles used: 283,874 files.",
    "format": "Source articles in XML; released dataset in I-O-B (IOB) formatted training files and TSV.",
    "annotation": "Automatically annotated by matching abbreviations from each article's \"Abbreviations\" section to text segments and recording character indexes; annotated with I-O-B scheme (B-AB for abbreviations, B-LF/I-LF for long-form tokens). Validation included manual sampling checks, spaCy-based language-model heuristics, length-based filters, and removal of erroneous entries."

    "calculation": "Token-level sequence-labeling evaluation: predicted I-O-B tags evaluated against gold I-O-B annotations to compute Precision, Recall, and F1 for abbreviations (B-AB) and long forms (B-LF/I-LF) on held-out test splits (70% train, 15% dev, 15% test).",
    "interpretation": "Higher Precision/Recall/F1 indicate better detection of abbreviations and long forms. Authors report RoBERTa variants as top-performing; performance drops when testing on out-of-domain/shared-task data indicating domain sensitivity.",
    "baseline_results": "Best reported results: F1-score ≈ 0.92 for abbreviations and ≈ 0.89 for long forms (e.g., RoBERTa large: Abbreviations F1=0.922 on PLOD unfiltered; RoBERTa large Long-forms F1≈0.898).",
    "validation": "Validation steps included manual inspection of random samples (500 and 1,000 samples), spaCy-based language-model heuristics to detect oddly formed long forms, length-based filtering of excessively long abbreviations/long-forms, removal of one-character abbreviations, and reporting of error rates (e.g., 5.5% wrong annotation, 26.7% missing annotation in a 1,000-sample analysis)."
