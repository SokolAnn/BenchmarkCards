    "overview": "OPENXRD is an open-book pipeline designed for crystallography question answering, integrating textual prompts with concise supporting content generated by GPT-4. This framework uses a dataset consisting of 217 expert-level XRD questions to evaluate different vision-language models. The results show significant accuracy improvements for models utilizing GPT-4.5-generated summaries, especially those with limited prior training in crystallography.",
