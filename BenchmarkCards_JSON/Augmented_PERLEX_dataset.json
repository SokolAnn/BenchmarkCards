    "calculation": "Followed official SemEval-2010-Task-8 evaluation: (9+1)-way classification (nine main classes plus 'Other'); 'Other' class is present in training/testing but ignored when computing Macro-F1; directionality is taken into account.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Macro-F1 indicates better performance; models are compared by Macro-F1 (the paper reports simple R-BERT as the best-performing model on PERLEX).",

    "validation": "Development evaluation performed on PERLEX; test evaluation on the NSURL 2021 shared task test data; evaluation uses the official SemEval-2010-Task-8 procedure (9+1 classes, Macro-F1, directionality considered)."
