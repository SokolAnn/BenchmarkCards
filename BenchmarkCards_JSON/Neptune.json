    "name": "Neptune",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "Neptune is a benchmark for long video understanding requiring reasoning over long time horizons and across different modalities. It covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities, including dense, time-aligned video captions and challenging question-answer-decoy sets for video segments.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on matching candidate answers to reference answers, with evaluations derived from human-annotated equivalence.",
    "interpretation": "Good performance is indicated by the ability to closely match human judgment on answer equivalence; underperformance shows a significant gap in understanding long videos.",
    "baseline_results": "Performance comparisons made against state-of-the-art models such as Gemini-1.5-pro and Video-LLaMA2",
    "validation": "Tested against a variety of state-of-the-art video understanding models including both open-source and proprietary systems."
