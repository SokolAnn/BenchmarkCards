    "name": "MVL-SIB (Massively Multilingual Vision-Language Benchmark)",
    "abbreviation": "MVL-SIB",
    "overview": "MVL-SIB is a massively multilingual vision-language benchmark that evaluates cross-modal and text-only topical matching across 205 languages. It addresses the need for evaluation data for low-resource languages, significantly extending the number of languages covered by existing benchmarks.",
    "data_type": "cross-modal and text-only topic matching tasks (image-sentence and sentence-image pairs)",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "The primary objective of MVL-SIB is to provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) in cross-modal topic matching across a wide array of languages, particularly focusing on low-resource languages.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are computed based on the proportion of correct responses provided by the models when selecting appropriate text or images for given prompts.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy reflects better topical matching performance by the models across different languages, especially in low-resource settings.",
