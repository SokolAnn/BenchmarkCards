    "name": "Live-E2T (Real-time Threat Monitoring in Video via Deduplicated Event Reasoning and Chain-of-Thought)",
    "abbreviation": "Live-E2T",
    "overview": "Live-E2T is a novel framework for real-time threat monitoring that identifies threatening behaviors in video streams and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory text. It uniquely combines high performance and explainability through its hierarchical understanding mechanism, event deduplication, and fine-tuned language model.",
