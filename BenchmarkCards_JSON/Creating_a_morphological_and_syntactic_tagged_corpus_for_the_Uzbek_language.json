    "overview": "We tried to fill that gap by developing a novel Part Of Speech (POS) and syntactic tag set for creating the syntactic and morphologically tagged corpus of the Uzbek language. This work also includes detailed description and presentation of a web-based application to work on a tagging as well. Based on the developed annotation tool and the software, we share our experience results of the first stage of the tagged corpus creation.",
