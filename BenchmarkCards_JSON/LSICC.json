    "name": "LSICC: A LARGE SCALE INFORMAL CHINESE CORPUS",
    "abbreviation": "LSICC",
    "overview": "Introduce a large-scale corpus of informal Chinese. This corpus contains around 37 million book reviews and 50 thousand netizen’s comments to the news. We explore the informal words frequencies of the corpus and show the difference between our corpus and the existing ones. The corpus can be further used to train deep learning based natural language processing tasks such as Chinese word segmentation, sentiment analysis.",

    "calculation": "Count frequencies of the 70 manually collected informal words and the total number of words in each corpus; compute proportion = informal word count / total word count (expressed in per mille).",
    "interpretation": "Higher proportion of informal words indicates a corpus is more representative of informal Chinese. LSICC has the highest proportion among compared corpora, indicating greater informality and suitability for informal-language tasks.",
