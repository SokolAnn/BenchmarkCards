    "overview": "DomainRAG is designed to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models in a domain-specific context, focusing on college enrollment. It includes six sub-datasets that assess abilities such as conversational RAG, structural information analysis, faithfulness to expert knowledge, denoising, solving time-sensitive problems, and understanding of multi-document interactions.",
