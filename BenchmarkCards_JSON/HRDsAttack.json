    "name": "HRDsAttack (Detecting Attacks on Human Rights Defenders)",
    "abbreviation": "HRDsAttack",
    "overview": "A new dataset (HRDsAttack) of crowdsourced annotations on 500 online news articles for detecting attacks on human rights defenders. Annotations include 13 fine-grained event attributes capturing perpetrator, violation type, victim information, location, and time. The dataset is used to train and evaluate baseline models on several sub-tasks to predict the annotated characteristics.",

    "calculation": "Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are used for PERPETRATOR MENTION and VIOLATION TYPE. Accuracy (percentage correct) is used for PERPETRATOR TYPE, VICTIM TYPE, VICTIM SEXTYPE, VICTIM AGE GROUP, COUNTRY, REGION, CITY, YEAR, MONTH, and DAY. For VICTIM NAME, both exact-match precision/recall/F1 and fuzzy-match precision/recall/F1 (a predicted name is correct if it has overlapping tokens with a ground-truth name) are reported.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Precision/Recall/F1 and Accuracy indicate better model performance on the respective event attributes. The paper selects a hybrid T5-based model based on dev set performance; attributes with low scores (e.g., REGION, DAY) indicate areas needing improvement.",
    "baseline_results": "Test set (selected metrics for Hybrid model): Perpetrator Mention Precision 93.81, Recall 100.00, F1 96.81; Perpetrator Type Accuracy 62.00; Victim Name Exact Match F1 47.44, Fuzzy Match F1 51.16; Violation Type F1 71.39; Country Accuracy 66.00; Region Accuracy 3.00; City Accuracy 23.00; Year Accuracy 46.00; Month Accuracy 33.00; Day Accuracy 14.00. (Full results reported in Table 5 of the paper.)",
    "validation": "Data split into train/dev/test with a 3:1:1 ratio (300/100/100). Dev set used for model selection (hybrid strategy). Pilot studies computed Turker agreement (average pair-wise Cohen-Kappa scores) and informed qualification criteria; targeted sampling used to mitigate class imbalance."
