    "goal": "To assess large language models (LLMs) on handling age-inappropriate questions and to provide a benchmark for testing AI moderation systems in educational contexts.",

    "source": "Curated dataset of 299 user queries categorized by content-based risks for children.",

    "metrics": [
      "Refusal Rate"
    ],
    "calculation": "Refusal Rate = (Number of refused prompts / Number of prompts in the category) Ã— 100.",
    "interpretation": "Higher refusal rates indicate stricter adherence to content-safety guidelines for child-unsafe requests.",
    "baseline_results": "Results vary significantly by model and system prompt variations, with some models achieving over 90% refusal rates.",
    "validation": "Testing was conducted across various prompts using six different LLMs under four variations of system prompts."
