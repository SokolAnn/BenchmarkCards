    "overview": "TrustSQL is a new benchmark designed to assess text-to-SQL reliability, defined as modelsâ€™ ability to correctly handle any type of input question by generating correct SQL queries for feasible questions and abstaining from infeasible ones.",

    "goal": "The primary objective of TrustSQL is to evaluate text-to-SQL reliability by integrating both feasible and infeasible questions.",

    "source": "TrustSQL was constructed using domain-specific datasets (ATIS, Advising, EHRSQL) and one cross-domain dataset (Spider).",

      "Reliability Score (RS)"
    ],
    "calculation": "The reliability is quantified as the difference between utility (correct SQL generations and correct abstentions) and risk (incorrect SQL generations).",
    "interpretation": "A reliability score (RS) of 100% indicates perfect reliability, and RS > 0 means the utility is greater than the risk.",

    "validation": "Models evaluated under different penalty scenarios."
