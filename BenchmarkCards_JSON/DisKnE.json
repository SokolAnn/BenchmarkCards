    ],
    "calculation": "F1 score is calculated for the positive class across different categories.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 scores indicate better performance of the models in reasoning tasks related to disease knowledge.",
    "baseline_results": "ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, SciBERT, and BERT were evaluated on the benchmark with varied performance in terms of F1 across categories.",
    "validation": "The evaluation involved detailed performance analysis of various language models on the benchmark."
