    "name": "MET-Bench (Multimodal Entity Tracking Benchmark)",
    "abbreviation": "MET-Bench",
    "overview": "MET-Bench is a multimodal entity tracking benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of vision-language models to track entity states across modalities using structured domains like Chess and the Shell Game.",
    "data_type": "multimodal",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To evaluate the limitations of current models in multimodal entity tracking, particularly focusing on how well they integrate textual and image-based state updates.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Model Developers"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Entity Tracking"
    ],
    "limitations": "The benchmark is restricted to two synthetic domainsâ€”Chess and the Shell Game, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world multimodal reasoning tasks.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Chess and Shell Game domains, using structured datasets and real game actions for evaluation.",
    "size": "Varies based on game configurations and actions.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Generated sequences of states and actions based on established game rules and state representations."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Human evaluation",
      "Automated metrics"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is calculated based on the correct tracking of entity states and actions as they are represented textually and visually.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better integration of visual and textual updates; poor performance implies limitations in reasoning across modalities.",
    "baseline_results": "Initial performance based on game start configurations for Chess and shell position for Shell Game.",
    "validation": "Results are validated through multiple experiments evaluating different models across structured test cases."
