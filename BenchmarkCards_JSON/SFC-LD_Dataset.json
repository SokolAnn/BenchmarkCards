    "overview": "The SFC-LD Dataset consists of paired textual representations of Sequential Function Charts (SFC) and Ladder Diagrams (LD) programs that conform to the IEC 61131-3 standard. It aims to facilitate the automation of LD-SFC conversion using Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing a rich data source for training and evaluation.",
