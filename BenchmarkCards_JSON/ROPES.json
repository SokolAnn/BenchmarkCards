    "name": "ROPES (Reasoning Over Paragraph Effects in Situations)",
    "abbreviation": "ROPES",
    "overview": "A challenging benchmark for reading comprehension targeting Reasoning Over Paragraph Effects in Situations. Systems are given a background passage describing cause/effect relations, a novel situation that uses this background, and questions that require reasoning about effects of the relationships in the background passage in the context of the situation. The dataset contains 14,322 questions collected from science textbooks and Wikipedia.",

    "limitations": "Annotator bias can produce high scores if the dataset is split by situations generated by the same annotators; authors separate training and test annotators to mitigate this and note that models have difficulty generalizing to new workers.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Background passages scraped from science textbooks and Wikipedia (scraped Marchâ€“April 2019). Life science and physical science concepts from www.ck12.org and textbooks from openstax.org were used. Background passages were selected by crowd workers and situations/questions/answers were authored via Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
    "size": "14,322 questions total; over 1,000 background passages collected; 588 background passages selected by workers. Train: 10,924 questions; Dev: 1,688 questions; Test: 1,710 questions.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Authored via Amazon Mechanical Turk: workers wrote situations, questions, and answers. Answers are spans from either the situation or the question. Expert human annotation was performed on a sample (400 random questions) to estimate human performance."

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated following the SQuAD evaluation setup (Exact Match and F1) over predicted answer spans; the background and situation are concatenated to form the passage as in SQuAD setup.",
    "interpretation": "Lower F1/EM indicates poorer ability to apply background knowledge to novel situations. The best baseline model achieves around 61.6% F1 (RoBERTa fine-tuned with RACE pretraining on test), while expert humans achieve 89.0% F1 on sampled questions. Many questions are designed as binary-like choices (e.g., \"more\" vs \"less\"), so some baseline scores are only slightly better than random guessing of the sensible choice.",

    "validation": "Human performance estimated by expert annotation on 400 random questions (ensuring no shared background/situation). Dataset split validation: authors separate annotators between train and test to mitigate annotator bias and test generalization to new workers."
