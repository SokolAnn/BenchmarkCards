    "overview": "POLUSA is a dataset that represents the online media landscape as perceived by an average US news consumer. The dataset contains 0.9M articles covering policy topics published between Jan. 2017 and Aug. 2019 by 18 news outlets representing the political spectrum. Each outlet is labeled by its political leaning, which the authors derive using a systematic aggregation of eight data sources. The news dataset is balanced with respect to publication date and outlet popularity.",

    "goal": "Provide a dataset of 0.9M online news articles covering policy topics (Jan. 2017 - Aug. 2019) balanced by time and outlet popularity to represent the online news landscape as perceived by an average US news consumer, enabling studies of media effects, political partisanship, and usage in data-intense deep-learning methods.",

    "limitations": "Dataset contains only English articles; temporal and popularity balancing choices trade off uniformity against the number of articles (more aggressive balancing would strongly reduce the number of articles); ten outlets with high temporal variation were dropped; outlets with low agreement among political-leaning measures (<0.75) are labeled as 'undefined'.",

Initial base selection contained articles from 30 news outlets (Jan. 2017 - Aug. 2019), reduced and processed to a final set of 18 outlets.

    "interpretation": "Classifier performance (F1, Precision, Recall) indicates the authors consider the policy-topic filtering to be high quality; articles with p(a) >= 0.75 are interpreted as likely reporting on policy topics. Balancing by time and by modeled popularity (via Alexa rank) is used to align the dataset to the perceived real-world distribution of what an average US news consumer reads.",
    "baseline_results": "Policy-topic classifier evaluation on 12.5% held-out data: F1 = 94.4, Precision = 95.6, Recall = 93.2.",
    "validation": "Classifier validated on a 12.5% held-out portion of the 0.6M labeled dataset. Outlet political-leaning reliability ensured by aggregating eight measures and labeling outlets with agreement < 0.75 as 'undefined'. Temporal distortions mitigated by dropping ten outlets with high temporal variation and by subsampling outlets with overly many articles relative to Alexa-rank-based popularity model. Near-duplicate removal reduces duplicate-content noise."
