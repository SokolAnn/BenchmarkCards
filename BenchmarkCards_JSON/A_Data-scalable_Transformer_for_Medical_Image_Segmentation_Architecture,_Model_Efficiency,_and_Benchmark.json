    "name": "A Data-scalable Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation: Architecture, Model Efficiency, and Benchmark",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We present MedFormer, a data-scalable Transformer designed for generalizable 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach incorporates three key elements: a desirable inductive bias, hierarchical modeling with linear-complexity attention, and multi-scale feature fusion that integrates spatial and semantic information globally. MedFormer can learn across tiny- to large-scale data without pre-training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MedFormer’s potential as a versatile segmentation backbone, outperforming CNNs and vision Transformers on seven public datasets covering multiple modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) and various medical targets (e.g., healthy organs, diseased tissues, and tumors). We provide public access to our models and evaluation pipeline, offering solid baselines and unbiased comparisons to advance a wide range of downstream clinical applications.",

    "calculation": "DSC = 2 |P ∩ G| / (|P| + |G|). 95% Hausdorff Distance (95HD) measures the largest symmetrical distance between two segmentation maps with 95% percentile to reduce outlier influence. (Formulas provided in Appendix C of the paper.)",
    "interpretation": "A DSC of 1 indicates a perfect segmentation while 0 indicates no overlap. Higher DSC indicates better overlap. Lower 95% Hausdorff Distance indicates better boundary agreement; 95% HD is used to reduce the impact of outliers.",
    "baseline_results": "Reported baseline results include: On the collected large cardiac MRI dataset (Table 1) MedFormer DSC: 5%: 87.72, 10%: 87.99, 40%: 88.80, 70%: 88.92, 100%: 89.05. On seven public datasets (Table 2) MedFormer average DSC = 82.83; nnUNet average DSC = 81.05. Detailed per-dataset and per-model results are provided in Tables 1-3 and appendices.",
    "validation": "Five-fold cross-validation on training sets for public datasets; M&Ms test set used as held-out test set for robustness evaluation across four vendor domains; AMOS reported on official validation set. The evaluation avoids ensembles, test-time augmentation, and post-processing to ensure fair comparison."
