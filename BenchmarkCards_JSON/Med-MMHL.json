    "name": "Med-MMHL: A Multi-Modal Dataset for Detecting Human- and LLM-Generated Misinformation in the Medical Domain",
    "abbreviation": "Med-MMHL",
    "overview": "A novel multi-modal misinformation detection dataset in a general medical domain encompassing multiple diseases. Med-MMHL incorporates both human-generated misinformation and misinformation generated by LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT). The dataset is intended to facilitate research and development of methods for detecting misinformation across diverse diseases and scenarios at the sentence, document, and multi-modal levels.",

    "limitations": "Due to the Twitter Developer Agreement, the authors release only tweet IDs (users must rehydrate to obtain full tweet content). LLM-generated fake tweets are not generated/released due to Twitter policy.

    "size": "12,968 total news items; 27,633 total tweets. Breakdown (explicit in paper): Real news 4,554; Human-generated fake news 469; LLM-generated fake news 2,095; Real claims 2,283; Fake claims 3,567; Real sentences 41,365; LLM fake sentences 17,608; Real tweets 7,738; Fake tweets 6,927.",

    "annotation": "Labels derived from fact-checking websites: summaries of fake news opinions labeled as 'fake claims' and fact-check corrections labeled as 'real claims'. Human-generated fake news taken from archived fake articles; LLM-generated fake news and fake sentences produced by prompting ChatGPT 3.5 and labeled as 'LLM fake'. Tweets labeled based on association with real or fake news titles. Images collected alongside articles when available."

    "interpretation": "Pretrained transformer-based methods outperform simpler methods; dataset imbalance leads to higher false positives and lower recall; LLM-generated fake sentences are more difficult to detect than LLM-generated fake news (document-level), indicating sentence-level detection is a challenging area.",

Fake tweet detection (only human-generated fake): FN-BERT Acc 98.602%, BERT Acc 98.056%. (Full tables provided in paper Tables 3 and 4.)",
    "validation": "Dataset split into training/validation/test with ratio 7:1:2. Extensive baseline experiments and analyses (text-level and embedding-level) were conducted to evaluate methods on the proposed tasks."
