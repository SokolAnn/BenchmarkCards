    "name": "PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation)",
    "abbreviation": "PerHalluEval",
    "overview": "PerHalluEval is the first dynamic hallucination evaluation benchmark for the Persian language, aimed at detecting extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations in large language models through a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline with human validation. It evaluates performance on QA and summarization tasks specific to Persian culture.",

    "goal": "To evaluate LLMs’ hallucinations in Persian regarding extrinsic and intrinsic categories of hallucination and to create a comprehensive resource for future NLP research in Persian.",

  "data": {
    "source": "The benchmark is constructed using existing Persian datasets: PN-Summary (for summarization) and PQuAD (for QA), with new hallucinated instances generated through a model-driven pipeline.",
    "size": "8,000 instances (4,000 for QA and 4,000 for summarization)",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Annotated by three human annotators based on majority vote."

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated by evaluating model predictions against the ground truth using definitions of True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives.",
    "interpretation": "High Factual Recall indicates accuracy in identifying factual content; high Hallucination Recall shows robustness in detecting hallucinations.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Inter-annotator agreement assessed using Gwet’s AC1 with high indices of 0.89 for QA and 0.91 for summarization."
