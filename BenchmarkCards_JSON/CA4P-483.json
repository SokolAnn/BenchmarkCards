  "data": {

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Two-phase annotation: coarse-grained paragraph-level annotation followed by fine-grained character-level annotation of seven components (controller, data entity, collection, sharing, condition, purpose, receiver). Annotation was performed by trained annotators (30 undergraduates for coarse phase with three instructors supervising; fine-grained annotation by selected undergraduates with instructor inspection). Each privacy policy was allocated to at least four annotators in the coarse phase. Inter-annotator agreement measured by Fleiss' Kappa with average 77.20% (substantial agreement)."

The paper reports BiLSTM-CRF as achieving the highest overall F1 (86.84%), while BERT-BiLSTM-CRF had lower overall performance (F1 51.18%), indicating varying effectiveness of model families on this dataset.",

    "validation": "Dataset split into training, development, and test sets (detailed in Table 2). Annotation quality validated via Fleiss' Kappa (average 77.20%). Baselines evaluated on train/dev/test splits and reported per-component and overall Precision/Recall/F1."
