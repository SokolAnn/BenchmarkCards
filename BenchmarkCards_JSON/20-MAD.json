    "abbreviation": "20-MAD",
    "overview": "This paper presents 20-MAD, a dataset linking the commit and issue data of Mozilla and Apache projects. It includes over 20 years of information about 765 projects, 3.4M commits, 2.3M issues, and 17.3M issue comments, and its compressed size is over 6 GB. The data contains typical information about source code commits (e.g., lines added and removed, message and commit time) and issues (status, severity, votes, and summary). The issue comments have been pre-processed for natural language processing and sentiment analysis (including emoticons and valence and arousal scores). Linking code repository and issue tracker information allows studying individuals in two types of repositories and provides more accurate time zone information for issue trackers.",

    "limitations": "Not exhaustive (some Apache projects missing, e.g., Apache httpd not included). Timestamp information incomplete due to prior use of SVN/CVS and missing time zone information. Identity merging is rudimentary and was only manually checked for the most active developers (previously >100 commits, re-checked for >1000 commits). NLoN's prediction model has not been retrained with Apache data leading to some non natural language Apache comments being considered natural language. The issue description was not consistently included in the NLP pipeline for Apache.",

NLP processing used established tools (NLoN, tokenizers, SentiStrength, Senti4SD); processing estimates (e.g., ~20 days on a laptop) and HPC timings are reported."
