    "overview": "SimpleQA is a benchmark that evaluates the ability of language models to answer short, fact-seeking questions. It contains 4,326 short, fact-seeking questions that are adversarially collected against GPT-4 responses, with each answer graded as correct, incorrect, or not attempted.",

    "goal": "To measure the factuality of frontier language models through a targeted evaluation of their ability to answer short, fact-seeking questions.",

    "source": "Data was created by AI trainers who generated question and answer pairs, with answers verified by another AI trainer.",

    "calculation": "The F-score is computed as the harmonic mean of overall correct and correct given attempted.",
    "interpretation": "A model that gets many questions correct while attempting those it is confident about would indicate ideal behavior.",
    "baseline_results": "Various OpenAI and Anthropic models were evaluated on SimpleQA, with GPT-4 showing different scores based on its configurations.",
    "validation": "Performance metrics were manually validated against a set of test answers."
