    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into benchmarking and generalization of uncertainty-driven routing strategies from small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) over 1500+ settings. It evaluates 8 uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods across 14 datasets to examine their alignment with correctness in routing tasks, proposing a calibration data construction pipeline to enhance routing generalization on new downstream scenarios.",
