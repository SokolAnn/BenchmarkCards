    "overview": "MME VALPRO is a multimodal benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors in evaluating Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) through a trilogy evaluation pipeline, consisting of an original question, a perception question, and a knowledge anchor question. It demonstrates a more accurate reflection of LMM capabilities and fosters trustworthiness in evaluations.",
