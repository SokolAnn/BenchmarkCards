    "name": "ALiiCE (Automatic LLMs’ Positional Fine-grained Citation Evaluation)",
    "abbreviation": "ALiiCE",
    "overview": "ALiiCE is the first automatic evaluation framework for positional fine-grained citation generation, utilizing a dependency tree based approach to parse sentence-level claims into atomic claims and evaluate citation quality using three metrics: positional fine-grained citation recall, precision, and coefficient of variation of citation positions.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are derived based on the performance of large language models in generating positional fine-grained citations in long-form QA responses.",
    "interpretation": "Higher values of citation recall and precision indicate better citation quality, and CVCP measures the dispersion of citation positions within sentences.",
