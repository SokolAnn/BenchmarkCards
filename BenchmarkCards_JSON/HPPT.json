    "name": "Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstracT (HPPT)",
    "abbreviation": "HPPT",
    "overview": "We introduce a novel dataset termed HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts), facilitating the construction of more robust detectors. It diverges from extant corpora by comprising pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-polished abstracts instead of purely ChatGPT-generated texts. We also propose the Polish Ratio method to measure the degree of modification made by ChatGPT compared to the original human-written text.",
