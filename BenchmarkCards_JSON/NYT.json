    "name": "New York Times Crosswords Dataset",
    "abbreviation": "NYT",
    "overview": "We introduce solving crossword puzzles as a new natural language understanding task and release a corpus of New York Times daily crossword puzzles from December 1, 1993 to December 31, 2018 (approximately 9,152 puzzles). We also release the clue-answer pairs from these puzzles as an open-domain question answering dataset containing over 578,000 unique clue-answer pairs. We provide baselines (sequence-to-sequence, retrieval-augmented generative models) and a constraint-satisfaction crossword solver, and propose an evaluation framework consisting of several complementary performance metrics.",

    "limitations": "Dataset release is contingent on finalizing agreement with The New York Times and exact licensing terms; special puzzles with non-standard rules were removed from validation and test splits; baseline crossword solver is limited (returns \"nosat\" when hard constraints are unmet) and current baselines rely on oracle-based pre-filtering to produce partial solutions.",

    "source": "New York Times daily crossword puzzles (daily NYT Crosswords) collected for the date range December 1, 1993 through December 31, 2018. Two specifications released: the NYT Crossword Puzzle dataset and the NYT Clue-Answer dataset (clue-answer pairs derived from the puzzles).",
    "size": "9,152 puzzles (split into 7,293 train / 922 validation / 941 test puzzles); 578,000 unique clue-answer pairs (433,033 train / 72,303 validation / 72,939 test examples).",
    "format": "N/A",

      "Automated metrics",
      "Model-based evaluation (sequence-to-sequence models: T5, BART)",
      "Model-based evaluation (retrieval-augmented generation: RAG-wiki, RAG-dict)",

      "Exact Match (EM)",
      "Contains (In)",

      "Contains normalized (In norm)",
      "Character Accuracy (Acc_char)",
      "Word Accuracy (Acc_word)",
      "Word Removal (Rem_word)",
      "Character Removal (Rem_char)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Clue-Answer: EM = model output matches ground-truth answer exactly; Contains = model output contains the ground-truth answer as a contiguous substring. Normalized metrics strip diacritics, accents, punctuation and whitespace from model output prior to computing the metric. Metrics are reported for top-k predictions (k from 1 to 20). Crossword Puzzle: Character Accuracy = percentage of characters in predicted solution matching ground-truth; Word Accuracy = percentage of words matching ground-truth; Removal metrics = percentage of words/characters that must be removed from the puzzle grid to produce a partial solution.",
    "interpretation": "Higher EM / In (and normalized variants) indicate better clue-answer performance. For puzzle solving, higher Acc_char and Acc_word indicate better full-puzzle solving. Higher Rem_word and Rem_char indicate greater constraint relaxation (i.e., more of the puzzle had to be redacted to obtain a solvable partial solution) and thus less meaningful completed puzzles.",
    "baseline_results": "Clue-Answer task (selected results): T5-base Top-1 EM 8.4; BART-large Top-1 EM 13.8; RAG-wiki Top-1 EM 24.2 (EM norm 26.0), RAG-wiki Top-20 EM 50.6 (In norm 56.7); RAG-dict Top-20 EM 50.0 (In norm 56.2).

    "validation": "Datasets split 80/10/10 (train/validation/test). For the clue-answer dataset duplicates removed; clue-answer pairs found in test or validation removed from training to prevent trivial memorization. A manually annotated subset of 1,000 test examples was used for per-clue-type analysis."
