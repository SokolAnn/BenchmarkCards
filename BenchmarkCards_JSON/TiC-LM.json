    "calculation": "Performance metrics are calculated using a matrix of evaluations based on model training at different timestamps compared against Oracle baseline results.",
    "interpretation": "Lower perplexity indicates better model performance, while metrics such as backward and forward transfer evaluate how well a model retains knowledge of past data and adapts to new data, respectively.",
    "baseline_results": "Oracle re-training series evaluated every two years.",
