    "abbreviation": "MCA-Bench",
    "overview": "MCA-Bench is the first end-to-end CAPTCHA security benchmark spanning four modalities—static visual recognition, point-and-click localization, interactive manipulation, and textual logic Q&A—across twenty real-world tasks. It provides over 180,000 training samples and a 4,000-item test set.",
