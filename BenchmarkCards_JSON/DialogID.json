    "abbreviation": "DialogID",
    "overview": "DialogID is a dataset of online dialogic instruction detection that contains 30,431 effective dialogic instructions extracted from real-world K-12 online classes and annotated into 8 categories. It is presented to help and promote research and development of tasks for online dialogic instruction detection and improving online teaching effectiveness.",

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "A 3-step annotation process: Step 1 extract teacher utterances using an in-house VAD model; Step 2 transcribe utterances via a self-trained ASR model and generate dialogic instruction candidates via keyword matching; Step 3 assemble candidate utterance with surrounding utterances into audio segments and have crowd workers assign labels after listening to each audio segment."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Model-based evaluation (pre-trained language models, e.g., RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, MacBERT, XLNet)",
      "Adversarial training enhanced evaluation (RoBERTa+AT)",

    "calculation": "Metrics are computed in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores as reported per instruction type and overall.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Precision/Recall/F1 indicate better detection performance. The authors state that RoBERTa achieves the highest prediction performance in terms of F1 score, indicating stronger capacity to model dialogic instructions, and that adding adversarial training (RoBERTa+AT) improves generalization as reflected by higher F1 scores (e.g., a 1.66% F1 increase in greeting).",
    "baseline_results": "Overall prediction performance - BERT: Precision 0.8534, Recall 0.9092, F1 0.8795; ELECTRA: Precision 0.8338, Recall 0.9145, F1 0.8720; MacBERT: Precision 0.8534, Recall 0.9064, F1 0.8779; XLNet: Precision 0.8505, Recall 0.8920, F1 0.8701; RoBERTa: Precision 0.8483, Recall 0.9167, F1 0.8802; RoBERTa+AT: Precision 0.8545, Recall 0.9183, F1 0.8849.",
    "validation": "Data split into training, validation, and test sets as shown in Table 2. Model training used max_len=128, learning rate=1e-5, up to 100 epochs with early stopping if no validation improvement for 5 epochs. Validation set performance was used for early stopping and model selection."
