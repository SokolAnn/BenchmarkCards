    "overview": "We present an evaluation benchmark, GLUECoS, for code-switched languages, that spans several NLP tasks in English-Hindi and English-Spanish. The benchmark includes Language Identification from text, Part of Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering and a new task for code-switching, Natural Language Inference.",

    "source": "Publicly available datasets and prior shared-task corpora, and one new NLI dataset by the authors.

NLI (new dataset), EMNLP 2014 LID, Bangor POS, CALCS NER, En-Es sentiment (Vilares et al.).",

    "calculation": "Task metrics (F1 Score and Accuracy) are computed on test sets. Code-switching statistics (CMI, SP Avg, M-index, I-index, Burstiness, LE, SE) are computed as described (Gambäck and Das, 2014; Guzmán et al., 2017) and reported in Table 2.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 Score or Accuracy indicates better task performance. Authors note that multilingual models (mBERT) outperform cross-lingual embeddings and that fine-tuning mBERT on synthetic plus small real code-switched data often yields the best results. The authors state that low accuracies on tasks such as Sentiment Analysis and NLI indicate these tasks are far from solved for code-switched languages.",
    "baseline_results": "Results for baseline and evaluated models are reported in Tables 3-8. Examples: LID En-Hi Mod. mBERT F1 = 96.6; LID En-Es Mod. mBERT F1 = 96.24; NLI En-Hi mBERT Accuracy = 61.09, Mod. mBERT Accuracy = 63.1. (See Tables 3-8 for full per-dataset results.)",
    "validation": "For datasets without official splits the authors create balanced 8:1:1 train:dev:test splits. Experiments were run with 5 random seeds and results reported are averages. Early stopping and validation-based model selection were used as described in Appendix B."
