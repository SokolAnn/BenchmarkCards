    "metrics": [
      "Whole-trace accuracy",
      "Steps to the first error"
    ],
    "calculation": "Model outputs are aligned with the expected execution traces and evaluated based on exact matches and the number of steps before the first error occurs.",
    "interpretation": "High accuracy indicates better procedural correctness and ability to execute rules step-by-step without deviation.",
    "baseline_results": "Results from evaluating 20 recent models reveal varying levels of procedural correctness, with larger and reasoning-enhanced models generally performing better.",
    "validation": "The benchmark was validated through systematic evaluation of multiple models across different configurations."
