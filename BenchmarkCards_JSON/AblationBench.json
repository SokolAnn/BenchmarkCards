    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "AblationBench is a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks: AuthorAblation, which assists authors in proposing ablation experiments, and ReviewerAblation, which helps reviewers find missing ablations in a paper.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the matches between generated ablations and ground truth ablations.",
    "interpretation": "Higher precision indicates a better match of proposed ablations to actual ablations, while higher recall indicates comprehensive identification of relevant ablations.",
    "baseline_results": "The best LM planners identify at most 34% of ablations in AuthorAblation and 26% in ReviewerAblation.",
    "validation": "Performance assessed against a dedicated evaluation dataset with human annotations."
