    "abbreviation": "GeoGLUE",
    "overview": "We propose a GeoGraphic Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark (GeoGLUE). We collect data from open-released geographic resources and introduce six natural language understanding tasks, including geographic textual similarity on recall, geographic textual similarity on rerank, geographic elements tagging, geographic composition analysis, geographic where what cut, and geographic entity alignment. We also provide evaluation experiments and analysis of general baselines.",

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "All datasets are annotated by experienced annotators trained with business rules. For Geo-Sequence Tagging tasks, 20 annotators used the BIOES scheme; a sample is considered correctly tagged when at least 70% of grouped annotators agree. For Geo-POI Searching, annotators select POIs within 1km; same POIs labeled as positives, neighboring POIs as hard negatives, others as normal negatives. Geo-Text Classification uses majority labeling (>=70% agreement). Annotated results were evaluated with Fleiss' Kappa scores described as favorable."

    "interpretation": "Higher MRR, Precision, Recall, and F1 scores indicate better retrieval, tagging, and alignment performance. MRR@5 emphasizes recall accuracy for retrieval; MRR@1 emphasizes top-1 correctness for reranking/geocoding; Micro-F1 evaluates tagging across classes; Macro-F1 evaluates classification balance across labels.",
