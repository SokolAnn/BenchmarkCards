    "name": "OAKINK2",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "OAKINK2 is a dataset of bimanual object manipulation tasks for complex daily activities. It introduces a structured representation for complex tasks, organizing them into three levels of abstraction: Affordance, Primitive Task, and Complex Task. The dataset provides multi-view image streams, 3D-pose annotations for human manipulation processes, and task specifications.",
