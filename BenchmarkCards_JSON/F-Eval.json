    "name": "F-Eval (Fundamental Abilities Evaluation Benchmark)",
    "abbreviation": "F-Eval",
    "overview": "F-Eval is a bilingual evaluation benchmark designed to assess the fundamental abilities of large language models (LLMs) including expression, commonsense, and logic. It consists of 15 sub-datasets with a total of 2211 instances, incorporating various task formats such as multi-choice and subjective tasks. The benchmark aims to facilitate the study of LLMs' fundamental abilities across different model sizes and dimensions.",
