    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "CONFLICT BANK is the first comprehensive benchmark developed to systematically evaluate knowledge conflicts in Large Language Models (LLMs) from three aspects: (i) conflicts encountered in retrieved knowledge, (ii) conflicts within the modelsâ€™ encoded knowledge, and (iii) the interplay between these conflict forms. It includes 7,453,853 claim-evidence pairs and 553,117 QA pairs.",
