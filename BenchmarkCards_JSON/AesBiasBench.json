    "overview": "AesBiasBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) along two dimensions: stereotype bias, measured by variations in evaluations across demographic groups, and alignment between model outputs and human aesthetic preferences. It includes three subtasks: Aesthetic Perception, Aesthetic Assessment, and Aesthetic Empathy, with structured metrics such as IFD, NRD, and AAS.",
