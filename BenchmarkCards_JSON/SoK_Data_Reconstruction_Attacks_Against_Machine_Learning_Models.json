    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper addresses the challenges in data reconstruction attacks against machine learning models by proposing a unified taxonomy, formal definitions, and a set of evaluation metrics. It also establishes a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction attacks and provides empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.",
