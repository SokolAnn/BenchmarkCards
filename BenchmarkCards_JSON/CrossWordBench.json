    "overview": "CrossWordBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles, integrating text-based clues and visual constraints. It allows for the dynamic generation of puzzles in text and image formats and supports adjustable difficulty levels and various evaluation strategies.",

    "calculation": "WCR measures word-level accuracy by calculating the percentage of correctly solved words; LCR evaluates letter-level accuracy; ICR measures the internal consistency of answers at intersections.",
    "interpretation": "Higher values in WCR, LCR, and ICR indicate better performance in solving crossword puzzles while adhering to structural constraints.",
    "baseline_results": "Includes performance comparisons across 20 evaluated models, highlighting reasoning models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1.",
    "validation": "Extensive evaluation across multiple model architectures, comparing performance on 7x7 and 14x14 grids."
