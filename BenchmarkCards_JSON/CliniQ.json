    "abbreviation": "CliniQ",
    "overview": "The paper introduces CliniQ, a novel public benchmark for Electronic Health Record (EHR) retrieval aimed at addressing the scarcity of available benchmarks. It includes two retrieval settings (Single-Patient and Multi-Patient Retrieval), utilizes a dataset of 1,000 discharge summaries from MIMIC-III, and features 1,246 unique queries with 77,206 relevance judgments.",
