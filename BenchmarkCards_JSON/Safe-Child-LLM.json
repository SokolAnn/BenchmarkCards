    "overview": "Safe-Child-LLM is a comprehensive benchmark and dataset for systematically assessing LLM safety across two developmental stages: children (7–12) and adolescents (13–17). It includes a dataset of 200 adversarial prompts with human-annotated labels for jailbreak success and a standardized ethical refusal scale.",
