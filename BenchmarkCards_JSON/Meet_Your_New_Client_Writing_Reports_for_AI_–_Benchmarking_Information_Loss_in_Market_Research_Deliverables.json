    "overview": "This study quantifies the information loss that occurs when documents are converted to Markdown for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It compares how well documents in PDF and PPTX formats can be used by large language models to answer factual questions, introducing an end-to-end benchmark and a corpus of 41 PPTX documents.",
