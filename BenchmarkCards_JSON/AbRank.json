    "name": "AbRank: A Benchmark Dataset and Metric-Learning Framework for Antibodyâ€“Antigen Affinity Ranking",
    "abbreviation": "AbRank",
    "overview": "AbRank introduces a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem, aggregating over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources. It defines standardized data splits that systematically increase distribution shift to improve the robustness of machine learning models in predicting antibody-antigen binding affinities.",
