Test-Other: 52 users; total LM train text sentences 444,520; average # audio-transcript utterances per user 56.5 (median 52); max audio utterances for one user 144.

    "calculation": "Average per-user WER is reported. 95% confidence intervals are calculated using the bootstrap technique by sampling per-user WERs with replacement 10,000 times.",
    "interpretation": "Lower WER indicates better ASR performance. The paper compares average per-user WER across conditions (no fusion baseline, fusion with general LM, fusion with personalized LMs) and reports improvements when using personalized LMs, with larger LMs and streaming models showing greater absolute improvements.",
    "baseline_results": "Baselines reported include: Streaming No Fusion (BL1) Test-Clean average WER 6.0% [5.3;6.7], Test-Other 11.2% [9.6;13.0]. Streaming Gen 10M LM (BL2) Test-Clean 5.4% [4.8;6.0], Test-Other 9.7% [8.3;11.1]. Nonstreaming No Fusion (BL1) Test-Clean 2.5% [2.1;2.8], Test-Other 6.8% [5.6;8.1]. With personalized LM fusion, examples: Streaming 25M p13n Test-Other 8.7% [7.4;10.2]; Nonstreaming 25M p13n All Users 3.2% [2.7;3.8]. (See Tables 2 and 3 in the paper for full results and CIs.)",
    "validation": "Validated by comparing to baselines (no fusion and fusion with a general 10M LM trained on LibriSpeech LM data). For speech personalization experiments, per-user ASR personalization used 5-fold cross validation for the 102 users with at least 10 audio-transcript pairs."
