    "name": "ACCORD (Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for COmbinatorial Optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention)",
    "abbreviation": "ACCORD",
    "overview": "ACCORD is a framework that encodes combinatorial constraints into an autoregressive text format and uses dynamic LoRA routing to probe an LLMâ€™s end-to-end ability on NP-hard tasks. It is associated with the ACCORD-90k dataset, which covers six NP-hard combinatorial problems, including TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.",

    "metrics": [
      "Feasibility",

    ],
    "calculation": "Feasibility is calculated as the percentage of generated solutions that satisfy all constraints. Optimality gap is defined as Model Value minus OR-Tools Value over OR-Tools Value, where a lower gap indicates a better solution.",
    "interpretation": "Higher feasibility percentages and lower optimality gaps indicate better performance for the model.",
    "baseline_results": "ACCORD consistently outperforms prompting methods across all six combinatorial optimization tasks.",
    "validation": "Extensive ablation studies demonstrate lower optimality gaps compared to traditional methods."
