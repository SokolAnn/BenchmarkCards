    "limitations": "Our research is designed for the Sino-Tibetan language family. However, the language features may not be generalized to other language families well. Furthermore, in our case, Hokkien has officially defined Mandarin characters. Without officially defined characters, it might be difficult to eliminate the differences between writing systems and create useful datasets. Finally, during data construction, we can directly mark the language, so we can assume language identification has 100% accuracy in the translation model. Without a good language identification system, the performance of the translation model might be affected.",

    "interpretation": "Higher BLEU and BERT-Score indicate better translation quality. Authors report that Dynamic Language Identification (DLI) and transfer learning (CLM/MLM stages) improve CM translation performance while preserving monolingual translation quality.
