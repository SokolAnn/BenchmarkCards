    "abbreviation": "DTM",
    "overview": "This study introduces Divergent Token Metrics (DTMs), a novel approach to assessing compressed LLMs, aiming to evaluate performance degradation during model compression processes, specifically targeting the first divergent token in generated text. DTMs provide a more nuanced evaluation compared to traditional metrics like perplexity, allowing for individual component assessment and effective compression strategies.",
