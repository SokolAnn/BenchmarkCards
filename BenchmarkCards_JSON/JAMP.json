    "name": "JAMP: Controlled Japanese Temporal Inference Dataset for Evaluating Generalization Capacity of Language Models",
    "abbreviation": "JAMP",
    "overview": "We present JAMP, a Japanese NLI benchmark focused on temporal inference. The dataset includes a range of temporal inference patterns (46 tense fragments) created from templates based on formal semantics, automatically generated using a Japanese case frame dictionary and well-designed templates while controlling the distribution of inference patterns and gold labels. We evaluate generalization capacities of monolingual/multilingual LMs by splitting the dataset based on tense fragments (temporal inference patterns).",

    "source": "Templates created from temporal inference problems in JSeM; vocabulary and case-frame selections from the Japanese case frame dictionary (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006); temporal expressions generated programmatically according to defined formats; templates based on formal-semantics-derived tense fragments.",
    "size": "10,094 examples total (9,750 training examples; 344 test examples). Training distribution: 3,050/3,340/3,360 (Entailment/Contradiction/Neutral). Test distribution: 114/112/118 (Entailment/Contradiction/Neutral).",

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics (accuracy)",
      "Model evaluation: zero-shot (monolingual)",
      "Model evaluation: zero-shot (cross-lingual)",
      "Model evaluation: fine-tuning (including splits by tense fragment, time format, time span)"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy computed as the proportion of correctly predicted labels. Reported as averages and standard deviations over five runs.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better ability to solve temporal NLI and generalize across the specified splits. Models achieve high accuracy on IID (seen) data but show large drops on unseen tense-fragment splits, indicating poor generalization for certain temporal phenomena (e.g., habituality).",
    "baseline_results": "Zero-shot accuracies (monolingual and cross-lingual) are approximately 40% on average. RoBERTa-large (fine-tuned) achieves up to 0.984 ± 0.01 accuracy on the IID fine-tuning setting. Large monolingual models generally outperform base models; models show substantial accuracy drops on unseen tense fragment splits.",
    "validation": "Manual inspection of all test examples by three graduate students (approximately 40% of generated test sentences were filtered out). Random sample of 100 test cases was manually checked for correctness; gold labels confirmed to be annotated as intended (with some debatable cases noted). Statistical analysis for dataset artifacts performed following Gardner et al. (2021) protocol to detect token-level spurious correlations."
