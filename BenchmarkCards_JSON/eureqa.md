# EUREQA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: EUREQA

**Overview**: EUREQA is an entity-searching task where a model finds a missing entity based on described multi-hop relations with other entities. The benchmark probes LLMs' dependency on semantic associations and their ability to follow correct reasoning paths.

**Data Type**: Question Answering

**Domains**:
- Reasoning
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MATH
- FLAN
- HellaSwag

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their reliance on semantic shortcuts.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- AI Developers
- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Evaluate reasoning paths
- Assess accuracy in entity identification

**Limitations**: The benchmark may not cover all reasoning mechanisms utilized by LLMs.

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Non-reasoning tasks
- General question-answering beyond the specified framework

## üíæ Data

**Source**: DBpedia knowledge base

**Size**: 2991 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Questions are generated with a focus on multi-hop reasoning and semantic associations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Direct prompting
- In-context learning prompting

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Semantic similarity correlation

**Calculation**: Accuracy is determined based on string-matching with gold references.

**Interpretation**: A model's performance is assessed by its ability to correctly identify entities based on their relational context.

**Baseline Results**: GPT-4 achieved 62% accuracy in identifying entities on EUREQA.

**Validation**: Results are validated through a majority vote from multiple runs, ensuring higher accuracy reliability.
