The released dataset consists of 477 self-reported expertise evaluations provided by 58 researchers who evaluated papers they have read previously.",

    "limitations": "Size limitation: 477 data points from 58 researchers. Prominent geographical skew with 74% of participants from the USA. Potential sampling bias (e.g., about 40% of participants affiliated with a certain university). Reliance on Semantic Scholar profiles which are automatically constructed and may be inaccurate. Survey design can influence collected data. Many papers in the dataset are published in or after 2020; citations and incoming citations available in dataset may not reflect information available in real-time conference settings.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Loss defined as sum over participants of pairwise penalties: for each pair of papers reported by a participant, if algorithm ordering disagrees with ground-truth expertise ordering, penalize by the absolute difference in reported expertise (|ε_i - ε_j|); if algorithm indicates a tie while expertise differs, penalize by half the difference. The unnormalized sum is normalized by the loss of an adversarial algorithm that reverses ground-truth ordering to obtain a final loss in [0,1]. 95% confidence intervals computed by bootstrapping participants (1,000 iterations). Profile construction randomness averaged by repeating profile construction 10 times (or 5 times in some experiments).",
    "interpretation": "Lower values of the normalized loss indicate better performance. Higher values of accuracy, MRR, NDCG, and Precision indicate better performance. Authors report error rates corresponding to pairwise comparisons: algorithms make 12%-30% mistakes in easy cases and 36%-43% mistakes in hard cases (as reported in the paper).",
