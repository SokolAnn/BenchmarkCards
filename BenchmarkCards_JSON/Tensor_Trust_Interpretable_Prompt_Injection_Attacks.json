    "name": "Tensor Trust : Interpretable Prompt Injection Attacks",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "Tensor Trust is a web-based game that allows players to create defense prompts for LLMs and attempt to bypass these defenses using prompt injections. The paper releases a dataset of over 126,000 prompt injection attacks and 46,000 defenses created by players, and introduces benchmarks for assessing LLMs' robustness against prompt extraction and hijacking attacks.",

    "calculation": "HRR is calculated as the percentage of times the model avoids outputting 'Access Granted' during prompt hijacking attacks; DV measures the percentage of times valid defenses produce 'Access Granted' outputs when given the actual access code.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores in HRR indicate better resistance to prompt hijacking, while higher DV reflects effective defense prompts.",
    "baseline_results": "Evaluated against models: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, Claude Instant 1.2, Claude 2.0, and LLaMA models.",
