    "overview": "Presents a dataset and measures for benchmarking tasks related to gender-inclusive language in German. Defines two tasks—flagging exclusive words (sequence labeling) and suggesting inclusive alternatives (sequence-to-sequence / style-transfer)—and provides annotated benchmark data and evaluation metrics to evaluate systems that detect exclusive (generic masculine) language and propose inclusive reformulations.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "Provide an evaluation benchmark (data and measures) for tasks related to gender-inclusive German: (1) detecting exclusive words (generic masculine) and (2) suggesting inclusive alternatives, enabling evaluation and comparison of inclusive-language systems.",

    ],
    "limitations": "400 annotated sentences; single annotator; dataset sampled and sorted by density of inclusive matches which may bias the benchmark towards texts with lots of potential for inclusive language (e.g., job advertisements); neutral-style texts may be underrepresented.",

  "data": {
    "source": "GC4 (German Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus) head part (web crawl) 2017-2020, filtered for inclusive texts, plus manual annotation to create parallel exclusive/inclusive sentence pairs.",
    "size": "400 entries (annotated sentences); 305 exclusive phrases; Entries with gender characters allowed: 272; Entries with gender characters used: 119; Crawl date range for source: 2017-2020.",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "Single annotator (author). For each inclusive sentence the annotator either discarded it, kept it (no labels), or created an exclusive version by editing the sentence, adapting grammar where needed, and flagging exclusive words. Annotation done via a minimal HTML/JavaScript interface with automatic suggestions for clear cases."

    ],
    "calculation": "Labeling task: per-word comparison of system-assigned label vs. benchmark label; compute Recall, Precision, F1. Suggestion task: check whether the benchmark target sentence is present among system suggestions (any position), among top-5, or at top-1; compute corresponding rates. Additionally compute a continuous suggestion score s(r) based on a generalized logistic function mapping the rank r to [0,1] (paper proposes using B=1 and v=0.01 and aggregating example scores by mean). Lemma-based variants of suggestion matching are also computed.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Recall/Precision/F1 indicate better detection of exclusive words. For suggestions, presence of the target sentence among candidates and higher suggestion score indicate better suggestion quality and ranking (score 1 if target is first suggestion, 0 if absent). Metrics are aggregated by mean across examples.",
    "baseline_results": "Labeling: Recall 0.888, Precision 0.818, F1 0.852. Suggestion task (words / lemmas): Correct in candidates 0.537 / 0.610; Correct in 5 best candidates 0.441 / 0.497; Correct in 1 best candidates 0.051 / 0.051; Suggestion score 0.492 / 0.559.",
    "validation": "Evaluated on the 400 annotated entries sampled from GC4 head part; ablation studies performed by disabling pipeline components and data subsets; metrics aggregated by mean. Processing-time measurements reported on random samples from German Wikipedia."
