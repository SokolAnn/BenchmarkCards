    "overview": "Introduce MedNLI - a dataset annotated by doctors, performing a natural language inference task (NLI), grounded in the medical history of patients. The paper presents strategies to leverage transfer learning from open-domain NLI datasets (e.g., SNLI) and to incorporate domain knowledge from external data and lexical sources (e.g., medical terminologies).",

    "goal": "Provide a publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for natural language inference in the clinical domain to enable research and evaluation of NLI systems grounded in patient medical history.",

      "Natural Language Inference (Recognizing Textual Entailment)"
    ],
    "limitations": "Each example in MedNLI was single annotated (no multiple annotations per pair). The dataset contains annotation artifacts similar to other NLI datasets. Some premises were discarded due to de-identification artifacts. Dataset size is modest compared to large open-domain NLI corpora.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Premises sampled from MIMIC-III v1.3 clinical notes (de-identified records of 38,597 patients; 2,078,705 clinical notes). Hypotheses generated and annotated by clinicians.",
    "size": "14,049 unique sentence pairs (Training: 11,232 pairs; Development: 1,395 pairs; Test: 1,422 pairs).",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Expert annotation by clinicians (two board-certified radiologists in pilot; two additional clinicians / board-certified medical students for final dataset). Single annotation per sentence pair. Labels: \"Definitely true\" (entailment), \"Maybe true\" (neutral), \"Definitely false\" (contradiction). Inter-annotator agreement (pilot) Cohen's kappa = 0.78."

    "calculation": "Accuracy computed on development and test sets. Model results reported as the average over 6 runs with different random seeds. The epoch with the lowest validation loss was selected for testing. Cohen's kappa computed for pilot inter-annotator agreement.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy indicates better NLI performance on MedNLI. Direct transfer from open-domain datasets is worse than in-domain baseline but may be better than random baseline (33.3%). Sequential and multi-target transfer can yield improvements. The neutral class is the hardest to recognize; annotation artifacts affect dataset behavior.",

    "validation": "Dataset split into training, development, and test with no premise overlap between splits. Models trained with early stopping based on validation loss; best epoch selected by lowest validation loss. Results averaged over 6 runs."
