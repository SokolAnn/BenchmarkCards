    "abbreviation": "CASA",
    "overview": "CASA is a benchmark designed to assess LLM agentsâ€™ sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. It evaluates the agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating queries and observations.",

      "Helpfulness Rate (Help-R)",
      "Violation Rate (Vio-R)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on agent responses to cultural and social norm violations.",
    "interpretation": "A higher score in AC-R, Edu-R, and Help-R indicates better cultural sensitivity, while a higher Vio-R indicates the agent's failure to recognize misleading content.",
    "baseline_results": "Current LLM agents show less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates.",
    "validation": "Evaluated through a comprehensive multi-step validation process."
