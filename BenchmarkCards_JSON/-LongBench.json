    "overview": " -LongBench introduces a length-controllable long-context benchmark and a novel metric, LongScore, to evaluate long-context capabilities of LLMs by disentangling baseline ability from long-context performance. It aims to provide a more accurate assessment of LLMs' true ability to handle extended contexts.",
