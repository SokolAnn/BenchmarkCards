    "calculation": "BLEU scores are calculated by segmenting characters for Chinese text and by words (case-insensitive) for English text.",
    "interpretation": "Higher BLEU scores indicate better performance in accurately recognizing text.",
    "baseline_results": "SimC-ESTR achieved BLEU scores of 0.638, 0.583, 0.500, and 0.430 for BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, and BLEU-4 respectively.",
