    "overview": "ToxSyn-PT is the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences annotated for toxicity, discourse type, and target group, created through a novel four-stage generation pipeline.",
