    "overview": "AHELM is a benchmark that aggregates various datasets to holistically measure the performance of audio-language models (ALMs) across 10 important aspects, including audio perception, reasoning, bias, and safety. It addresses the lack of standardized benchmarks and introduces new datasets for evaluating multimedia models.",
