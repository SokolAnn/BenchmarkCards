    "source": "Collected from two online trackers of news article updates: NewsSniffer and DiffEngine, covering article versions from 22 media outlets (including The New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, BBC, Guardian, Reuters) across 2006-2021.",
    "size": "1.2 million articles; 4.6 million versions. Paper reports summary statistics including ≈36.1 million changed sentences, 21.7 million added sentences, 14.2 million removed sentences, and the paper also states 'We count over 40 million Edits, Additions, Deletions or Refactors' in NewsEdits.",
    "format": "SQLite (5 tables: articles, sentence_diffs, word_diffs, plus two summary-statistic tables)",
    "annotation": "Automatic extraction of sentence-level edit-actions using an asymmetrical sentence-matching algorithm (embedding- and BLEU-based variants) applied to the full corpus; manual annotation by expert annotators (two expert annotators for 280 documents for sentence matching to set hyperparameters and evaluate matching; five professional journalists for human evaluation tasks and task annotations)."

    "calculation": "Counts for Task 2 are binned ([0,1), [1,3), [3,∞)) and predictions evaluated as multiclass classification; Macro and Micro F1 are reported across bins. Reported scores are the median of 1,000 bootstrap resamples of the evaluation dataset.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 indicates better prediction. The paper shows current large language model-based predictors provide a baseline above random guessing in most tasks, though expert human journalists perform significantly better.",
    "baseline_results": "Task 1 (next-version prediction): Baseline RoBERTa = 60.8 F1 (median), Random = 50.6, Most Popular = 56.6, Human = 80.1. Task 2 (binned counts): Example Num. Additions baseline (n=150,000) Macro F1 = 29.7, Micro F1 = 36.3; Human Num. Additions Macro F1 = 66.4, Micro F1 = 69.3. Task 3 (sentence-level): Sentence Operations baseline Macro F1 = 36.5, Micro F1 = 61.9; Human Sentence Operations Macro F1 = 63.8, Micro F1 = 63.5. (All scores are reported in paper tables as medians over 1,000 bootstrap resamples.)",
    "validation": "Human-annotated sentence matches (n=280) were split 50% for hyperparameter tuning and 50% for evaluation of matching algorithms. Evaluation sets for tasks were sampled balanced by class labels (4k documents per evaluation set where noted). Reported task scores are medians over 1,000 bootstrap resamples."
