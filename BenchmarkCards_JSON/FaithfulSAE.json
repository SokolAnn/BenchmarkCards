    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated by measuring the differences and performance across different seed initializations for SAEs trained on various datasets.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Shared Feature Ratio (SFR) indicates better stability and interpretability of the features captured by the SAEs.",
    "baseline_results": "SAEs trained on Faithful dataset exhibited a higher SFR and a lower Fake Feature Ratio compared to those trained on other datasets.",
