    "abbreviation": "SYCON",
    "overview": "SYCON BENCH is a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. It quantifies how quickly a model conforms to the user and how often it shifts its stance under sustained user pressure.",
    "data_type": "multi-turn prompts",

      "Natural Language Processing"
    ],

    "goal": "To evaluate and quantify sycophancy in real-world settings involving multi-turn, free-form interactions.",

    "methods": [
      "LLM-based evaluation",

    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Turn of Flip (ToF)",
      "Number of Flip (NoF)"
    ],
    "calculation": "ToF measures the earliest turn where model response diverges from the expected stance. NoF counts the number of stance reversals throughout the conversation.",
    "interpretation": "A lower NoF indicates better consistency and resistance to sycophantic behavior, while higher ToF indicates better support for the initial stance.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "Evaluated against both LLM and human-generated annotations."
