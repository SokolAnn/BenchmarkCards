    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated using standard formulas for binary classification, including true positives, false positives, etc.",
    "interpretation": "MCC values close to 1 indicate better model performance, while lower values suggest poor predictions.",
    "baseline_results": "Performance benchmarked using several existing methods with notable improvements using the introduced method WALLE.",
    "validation": "Tested using a random split based on the ratio of epitope to antigen surface residues and a split by epitope groups."
