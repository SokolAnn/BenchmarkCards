    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "MVGBench is a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture, image quality, and semantics. It allows fair comparison of existing MVGs and systematically analyzes different models to identify critical design choices.",
