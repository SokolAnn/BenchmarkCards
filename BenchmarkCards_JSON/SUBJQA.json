    "abbreviation": "SUBJQA",
    "overview": "We release an English QA dataset (SUBJQA) based on customer reviews, containing subjectivity annotations for questions and answer spans across 6 domains.",
    "data_type": "question-answering pairs (text from customer reviews)",
    "domains": [
      "TripAdvisor",

    "goal": "To investigate the relationship between subjectivity and question answering in customer reviews by providing a QA dataset with subjectivity annotations for questions and answer spans across 6 domains.",
    "audience": [],
    "tasks": [
      "Question Answering",
      "Answer Span Extraction",
      "Subjectivity Classification"
    ],
    "limitations": "The dataset generated is not guaranteed to only contain answerable questions; KBs used in dataset construction achieved 35-50% mean precision on various domains; a small fraction of the answer spans are noisy.",
    "out_of_scope_uses": []
  },
  "data": {
    "source": "Customer reviews from TripAdvisor (Wang et al., 2010), Yelp dataset (Restaurants), and Amazon product reviews (McAuley and Yang, 2016b); opinion extractions obtained using OpineDB and syntactic extraction patterns.",
    "size": "Over 10,000 examples (domain totals provided in paper: TripAdvisor 1,686 examples; Restaurants 1,683 examples; Movies 1,677 examples; Books 1,668 examples; Electronics 1,659 examples; Grocery 1,725 examples).",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Crowdsourced via Appen: annotators write questions from topics/reviews, highlight the shortest answer span in the review or mark the question as unanswerable, and provide subjectivity scores for both the question and the answer span on a 1-5 scale. Quality control included embedded expert-labeled items and a worker accuracy threshold."
  },
  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Human crowdsourcing annotation (Appen) for question generation, answer-span highlighting, subjectivity scoring, and answerability labels",
      "Automated dataset construction using opinion extraction and non-negative matrix factorization (neighborhood model) to pair topics and reviews",
      "Automated evaluation of QA models (fine-tuning pre-trained models)",
      "Multi-task learning (subjectivity-aware QA model trained to predict subjectivity label and answer span simultaneously)"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "F1 Score",
      "Exact Match",
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "N/A",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 Score and Exact Match indicate better QA performance. The paper reports that pre-trained models perform much lower on SUBJQA than on factual datasets; fine-tuning substantially improves F1 on SUBJQA; a subjectivity-aware multi-task model further improves average F1 across domains.",
    "baseline_results": "Pre-trained models achieve up to 92.9% F1 on SQuAD. Pre-trained models obtain an average F1 of 30.5% across SUBJQA domains (36.5% F1 at best on any given domain). After fine-tuning on SUBJQA domains the best model achieves an average F1 of 74.1% across domains. The subjectivity-aware multi-task model achieves an average F1 of 76.3% across domains.",
    "validation": "Topics partitioned into train/dev/test splits by topic (80%/10%/10%). Crowdsourcing quality control via Appen with embedded expert-labeled items and a worker accuracy requirement (70%). Manual inspection and analysis of sampled items (e.g., manual inspection of 100 randomly chosen questions)."
