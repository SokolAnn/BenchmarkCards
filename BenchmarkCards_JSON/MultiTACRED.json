    "name": "MultiTACRED: A Multilingual Version of the TAC Relation Extraction Dataset",
    "abbreviation": "MultiTACRED",
    "overview": "We introduce the MultiTACRED dataset, covering 12 typologically diverse languages from 9 language families, which is created by machine-translating TACRED instances and automatically projecting their entity annotations. We analyze translation and annotation projection quality, identify error categories, and experimentally evaluate fine-tuned pre-trained mono- and multilingual language models in common transfer learning scenarios.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "Provide a large-scale, supervised multilingual version of the TACRED relation extraction dataset by machine-translating TACRED instances and projecting entity annotations, and to analyze translation/projection quality and model performance across monolingual, cross-lingual and mixed training scenarios.",

    "tasks": [
      "Relation Extraction",
      "Cross-lingual transfer evaluation"
    ],
    "limitations": "Dependence on machine translation quality and automatic annotation projection; token-level alignment is inadequate for compounding and highly inflectional languages; lack of original-language test instances for full evaluation; dataset limited to person- and organization-related relations from news and web text.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Created by machine-translating the TACRED dataset instances and automatically projecting their token-offset head and tail entity annotations; uses TACRED labels (with option to apply label corrections such as Alt et al. (2020) or Stoica et al. (2021)).",
    "size": "Original TACRED splits: 68,124 train; 22,631 dev; 15,509 test (per language before validation); intersection test set available in all languages: 11,874 instances. Total translated source characters: 22.9 million characters. On average 2.3% of instances discarded due to invalid entity tag markup after translation.",
    "format": "JSON (same format as original TACRED: tokens, entity types and offsets, label, instance id)",
    "annotation": "Entity span annotations and relation labels are automatically projected from the translated token offsets. Manual validation was performed on random samples (100 instances per language) by native speakers; no large-scale manual re-annotation of the full dataset."

      "Micro-F1",

    "calculation": "Micro-F1 is used as the primary evaluation metric. Report median micro-F1 (and precision/recall) over 5 runs with fixed random seeds. Micro-F1 on dev set used for hyperparameter selection.",
    "interpretation": "Higher micro-F1 indicates better relation extraction performance. Authors note that absolute scores are not directly comparable across languages due to differences in valid training/test instance counts introduced by translation/validation; therefore they additionally report scores on the intersection test set (instances available in all languages).",
    "baseline_results": "English BERT monolingual baseline: median micro-F1 = 77.1 on the original English test set. Monolingual target-language BERT models achieve median micro-F1 scores (testL) ranging, e.g., from 65.1 (Hindi) to 76.4 (Finnish) as reported in Table 2. Cross-lingual and mixed training results and per-language scores are reported in the paper (Tables 2-5).",
    "validation": "Automatic validation: check correctness of XML-style entity markup after translation and discard invalid translations (on average 2.3% discarded). Manual validation: for each language, 100 random training instances were judged by a single native speaker answering Q1 (semantic relation preserved) and Q2 (linguistic acceptability). Average Q1 = 87.5% and average Q2 = 83.7%."
