    "name": "ERBench: An Entity-Relationship based Automatically Verifiable Hallucination Benchmark for Large Language Models",
    "abbreviation": "ERBench",
    "overview": "ERBench is a benchmark that utilizes relational databases based on the entity-relationship model to create complex, automatically verifiable evaluations for large language models. It measures the capability of LLMs to reason correctly while minimizing hallucinations.",
    "data_type": "question-answering pairs",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To provide an automated and scalable framework for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models while addressing the issue of factual hallucination.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Industry Practitioners",
      "Model Developers"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Question Answering"
    ],
    "limitations": "The benchmark primarily checks for critical keywords to verify LLM rationales, which may not cover the correctness of the entire rationale.",
    "out_of_scope_uses": []
  },
  "data": {
    "source": "Public relational databases from various domains including movie, soccer, airport, music, and book datasets, sourced from reputable platforms like Kaggle and GitHub.",
    "size": "varied based on the chosen database; typically includes thousands of entities and relationships",
    "format": "Relational database format",
    "annotation": "Automatically generated using integrity constraints such as functional dependencies and foreign key constraints."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics",
      "Model-based evaluation"

    "metrics": [
      "Answer Accuracy",
      "Rationale Accuracy",
      "Answer-Rationale Accuracy",
      "Hallucination Rate"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the correctness of answers and rationales derived from integrity constraints present in the relational databases.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy values indicate better performance of LLMs in generating both correct answers and rationales, while lower hallucination rates suggest fewer incorrect responses.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "Experimental validation conducted across multiple datasets using various contemporary large language models."
