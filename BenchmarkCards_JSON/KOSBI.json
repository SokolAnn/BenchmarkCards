    "name": "KOSBI (Korean Social Bias)",
    "abbreviation": "KOSBI",
    "overview": "KOSBI is a new social bias dataset of 34k pairs of contexts and sentences in Korean covering 72 demographic groups in 15 categories. It provides context-sentence pairs labeled as safe or unsafe (and unsafe subtypes: stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination, other) to measure and mitigate social biases in large language model generated content.",

    "goal": "To address social biases against a comprehensive set of demographic groups in South Korea by providing context-sentence pairs labeled as safe or unsafe so that LLMs can be trained/evaluated to behave safely when discussing demographic groups.",

    "limitations": "KOSBI addresses social bias based on Korean culture with the Korean language. This Korean-specific property might restrict the effectiveness of our dataset outside Korea and similar cultures. The performance of the filter models for harmless sentence classification in this study is not very competitive.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Generated by HyperCLOV A (LLM) via in-context few-shot prompting and demonstration-based prompting; initial demonstration pool manually curated by authors; generated contexts and sentences were filtered and then annotated by crowd workers. Demographic categories/groups were selected based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK).",
    "size": "34,214 context-sentence pairs (Train: 27,370; Validation: 3,421; Test: 3,423)",

    "annotation": "Crowd-sourced annotation by 200 crowd workers. Each instance labeled by three annotators and final label decided by majority vote. Labels: safe/unsafe and unsafe subtypes (stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination, other). Inter-annotator agreement reported via Krippendorff's alpha."

      "Expected average safety score of safe sentences over k generations",

    ],
    "calculation": "Empirical probability: probability that at least one generated sentence is classified as safe (safe score ≥ 0.5) over k generations. Expected average safety: average safety score of safe sentences over k=8 generations. Classifier metrics reported as Macro F1 and Accuracy for fine-tuned models.",
    "interpretation": "Higher empirical probability indicates a model more frequently generates at least one safe continuation given a context. Higher expected average safety indicates that generated sentences are, on average, safer. Macro F1 and Accuracy indicate performance of safe sentence classifiers.",
    "baseline_results": "Table 4 shows Macro F1 (%) on the test set: BEEP! (KcBERT) 52.90; APEACH (KcBERT) 48.82; KOLD (KLUE-BERT) 38.15; Hatescore (KcBERT) 40.28; Unsmile (KcBERT) 48.02; Ours (KLUE-BERT) 69.94; Ours (KcELECTRa) 71.21.",
    "validation": "Data split into Train/Validation/Test with 80%/10%/10% considering balance of social group distribution. Human evaluation: three crowd workers annotated contexts and sentences; final labels by majority vote. Inter-annotator agreement reported via Krippendorff's alpha for various labeling tasks. An augmented test set (6,801 pairs) was used for additional evaluation and human studies."
