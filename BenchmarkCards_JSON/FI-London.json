    "goal": "To develop a zero-shot classifier that predicts the age epoch of buildings based on their facade images, tackling challenges of geographical data scarcity and model training.",

    "calculation": "Micro F1 Score is calculated as 2 × (Precision Micro × Recall Micro) / (Precision Micro + Recall Micro). MAE is the average absolute difference between predicted and actual mid-years of the age epochs.",
    "interpretation": "A lower MAE indicates better predictive accuracy, especially for buildings near the boundary of two epochs.",
