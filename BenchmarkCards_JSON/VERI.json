    "name": "VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition Dataset)",
    "abbreviation": "VERI",
    "overview": "VERI is a diagnostic benchmark designed to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to distinguish between genuine emergency situations and visually similar but safe scenarios. It comprises 200 synthetic images and 50 real-world images, organized into three categories: Accidents & Unsafe Behaviors, Personal Medical Emergencies, and Natural Disasters.",

    "goal": "To evaluate the performance of VLMs in safety-critical scenarios and to assess their reliability in distinguishing genuine emergencies from visually similar yet safe situations.",

    "source": "VERI dataset includes synthetic images created via a multi-stage process and validated with real-world images.",
    "size": "250 images",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Images were annotated through multiple rounds of human verification and descriptive captions were generated for each image pair."

    "metrics": [
      "Precision",
      "Recall",
      "F1 Score"
    ],
    "calculation": "Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed based on human-annotated binary ground truth labels.",
    "interpretation": "High precision indicates fewer false positives, while high recall indicates good detection of true emergencies. A balance between both metrics is ideal for assessing VLMs in emergency recognition.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "The benchmark was validated through comparative evaluations with both synthetic and real-world pairs."
