    "calculation": "Recall accuracy is calculated based on the model's ability to correctly identify relevant images, while localization accuracy uses Precision at 50% overlap threshold (Pr@50).",
    "interpretation": "High recall accuracy indicates effective image searching, while high localization accuracy indicates precise object detection.",
