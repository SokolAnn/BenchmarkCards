    "name": "A Language-Guided Benchmark for Weakly Supervised Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We propose a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network (WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts to image features using frozen CLIP and ii) decouples weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation.",

    "size": "PASCAL VOC 2012: 11,185 training images and 1,449 validation images (20 semantic classes). MS COCO 2014: 82,081 training images and 40,137 validation images (80 semantic classes).",

    "calculation": "Evaluation metrics follow conventions used in prior work [56]. Results are reported as mIOU per fold and as seen/unseen/harmonic mIOU in tables. (The paper states metrics follow conventions in [56]; detailed formulae beyond table reporting are not provided in the text.)",
    "interpretation": "Higher mIOU and harmonic mIOU indicate better segmentation performance. The paper compares absolute mIOU and harmonic mIOU values across methods and reports improvements in mIOU points over baselines.",
    "baseline_results": "The paper reports that WLSegNet beats existing weakly supervised baselines by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC, and beats weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation baselines by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO. In 2-way 1-shot weak FSS, WLSegNet outperforms baselines by 13 and 22 mIOU points on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO respectively. Detailed per-table numbers are reported in Tables 1-9 of the paper.",
    "validation": "Validated via extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC (Pascal-5i splits) and MS COCO (COCO-20i splits) across multiple folds and settings (WZSS, WGZSS, WFSS, Cross-dataset), with ablation studies varying prompt strategies, mask proposal methods, CLIP backbones and pseudo-label generators; qualitative visualizations are also provided."
