    "overview": "We propose a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that generates content-aware text logo layouts by integrating multi-modal inputs with user-defined constraints, enabling more flexible and robust layout generation for real-world applications. We introduce two extensive text logo datasets that are five times larger than existing public datasets.",

    "calculation": "Metrics such as FID and IS assess visual quality, while IoU, Visual Balance, and Ratio measure geometric aesthetics and layout adherence.",
