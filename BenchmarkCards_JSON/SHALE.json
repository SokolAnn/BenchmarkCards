    "abbreviation": "SHALE",
    "overview": "SHALE is a scalable hallucination benchmark designed to assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained hallucination categorization scheme, comprising over 30K image-instruction pairs across various evaluation tasks and scenarios.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Non-hallucination rates are calculated by prompting an LLM to assess if responses from models are hallucination-free.",
    "interpretation": "A higher non-hallucination rate indicates better model performance in handling hallucinations.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Extensive experiments were conducted on over 20 mainstream LVLMs revealing significant factuality hallucinations and model sensitivities."
