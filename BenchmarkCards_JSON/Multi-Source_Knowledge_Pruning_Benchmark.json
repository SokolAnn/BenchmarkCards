      "Missing Rate"
    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is calculated based on matching predicted answers with ground truth; hallucination is gauged through semantic alignment comparisons.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy signifies better information retrieval while lower hallucination rates signify fewer misleading outputs.",
    "baseline_results": "Performance comparison with several RAG frameworks was conducted, demonstrating improved accuracy and reduced hallucination with the PruningRAG framework.",
    "validation": "Evaluation involved metrics comparing RAG performance under various knowledge sources."
