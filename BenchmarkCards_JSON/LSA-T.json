    "abbreviation": "LSA-T",
    "overview": "Presents LSA-T, the first continuous Argentinian Sign Language (LSA) dataset for Sign Language Translation. It contains 14,880 sentence-level video segments extracted from the CN Sordos YouTube channel with corresponding Spanish sentence labels and keypoint annotations per signer. The paper also provides a method to infer the active signer, a visualization tool, and a baseline neural SLT model using keypoints.",

    "limitations": "High proportion of unique sentences (≈95%) and a large fraction of singletons (≈50% of vocabulary) making training and evaluation challenging; a large portion of test samples contain tokens not present in the train set (≈60% in full version, ≈85% in reduced version); samples with signer-confidence score lower than 0.5 were discarded.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Videos from the CN Sordos YouTube channel (videos annotated with subtitles by the channel authors / LSA experts).",
    "size": "14,880 video segments spanning 21.78 hours of video",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Spanish sentence labels (subtitles provided by authors); keypoint annotations computed using AlphaPose with Halpe full-body format (136 keypoints, 42 hand keypoints); signer inference score and inferred active signer per sample."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Model-based evaluation (baseline neural SLT model using keypoint inputs and transformer layers)",
      "Automated metrics (WER and WER-N)",
      "Train-test evaluation with two default splits (full and reduced versions; 80% train / 20% test)"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Word Error Rate (WER)",
      "WER-N (proposed variant of WER that ignores errors for target tokens with training frequency lower than N)"
    ],
    "calculation": "WER-N is computed via a variant of the Edit Distance algorithm where deletion and substitution costs are set to 0 for target tokens whose frequency in the training set is lower than N; otherwise costs follow standard definitions. The paper provides the recursive edit-distance formulation and defines C(D) and C(S) to be 0 when token frequency < N and 1 otherwise.",
    "interpretation": "High WER indicates poor translation performance due to dataset difficulty (many rare tokens and unique sentences). WER-N mitigates penalization for rare tokens by ignoring errors on tokens seen fewer than N times in training; lower WER-N indicates better model handling of frequent tokens. The authors report that the baseline model performs poorly on this dataset, illustrating its challenging nature.",
    "baseline_results": "Full version (Train/Test): WER 0.9387 / 0.9392; WER-5 0.8116 / 0.7892; WER-10 0.7547 / 0.7154. Reduced version (Train/Test): WER 0.9207 / 0.957; WER-5 0.7982 / 0.68; WER-10 0.7193 / 0.5904.",
    "validation": "Two versions of train-test splits provided: full and reduced. Reduced version excludes labels with words of frequency lower than 5. Both use an 80% train / 20% test split. Samples with signer-confidence score < 0.5 were discarded. Train and test sets were constructed such that segments from the same video may appear in both sets."
