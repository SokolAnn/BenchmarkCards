  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "The primary objective of the benchmark is to provide a robust evaluation framework for adversarial attack detection methods in Natural Language Processing.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",

      "Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)",
      "False Positive Rate (FPR)",
      "Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the detection performance of adversarial examples versus clean examples.",
    "interpretation": "Higher AUROC indicates better overall performance. Lower FPR indicates fewer clean examples misclassified as adversarial.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline methods include detectors based on Mahalanobis distance and language model likelihood.",
    "validation": "Extensive numerical experiments were conducted to assess the robustness of the detection methods."
