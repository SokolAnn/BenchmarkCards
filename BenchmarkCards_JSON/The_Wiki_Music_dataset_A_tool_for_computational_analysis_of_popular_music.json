    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "A hand-crafted dataset intended to combine features about style, psychology, sociology and typology, annotated by music genre and indexed by time and decade. The authors collected a list of popular genres by decade from Wikipedia, scored music genres based on Wikipedia descriptions, and used statistical and machine learning techniques to find trends and to forecast characteristics of future music genres.",

  "data": {
    "source": "77 genres selected from Wikipedia; genres were scored by reading Wikipedia pages and listening to samples or artists, then annotated by two independent raters.",

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Annotated by two independent raters. Agreement measured with Cronbach's alpha: average alpha = 0.793; genre scale alpha = 0.957. Divergences were agreed upon and scores were averaged or corrected accordingly."

    "calculation": "Average accuracy defined as a = count(|l - h| < 0.1) / count(t), where l is the label and h is the prediction and t is the year series.",
    "interpretation": "Forecasting of music genres is a non-linear problem. IBk predicts the closest sequence to the annotated one and a meta-classifier with nearest neighbors is the most accurate. Deep Learning algorithms do not perform well due to dataset size. Feature reduction from 41 to 14 does not affect results obtained with IBk and meta-classifiers.",
