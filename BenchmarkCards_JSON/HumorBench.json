    "overview": "HumorBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models’ (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in cartoon captions. It includes approximately 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying essential joke elements.",

    "calculation": "Models are evaluated based on whether their explanations cover the essential components of the joke as verified by expert annotations.",
    "interpretation": "A higher accuracy percentage indicates a better understanding and explanation of the humor.",
    "baseline_results": "Top-performing models achieved accuracies around 60% on the HumorBench-hard subset.",
    "validation": "Performance validated by comparing LLM outputs against human-generated explanations."
