    "overview": "A dataset and benchmark for the task Personality-aware Human-centric Multimodal Reasoning (PHMR, T1): forecasting the most probable future behavior of a particular individual in social interactions by integrating multimodal signals from past moments (video, audio, dialogue) and personality traits. The authors construct PHMRD from six television shows (TVQA source), covering 225 characters and 12,616 samples, and propose baselines and an extension task Personality-predicted Human-centric Multimodal Reasoning (T2) with a corresponding dataset (MPPD).",
