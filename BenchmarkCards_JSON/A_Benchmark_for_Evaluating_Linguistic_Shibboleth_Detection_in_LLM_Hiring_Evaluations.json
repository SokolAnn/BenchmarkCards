    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths, which are subtle linguistic markers that can reveal demographic attributes. The benchmark consists of 100 validated question-response pairs designed to measure demographic bias in automated evaluation systems.",

    "calculation": "Scores calculated on a scale from 1 to 5 based on clarity, relevance, and depth of responses.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate better responses, with a particular focus on mitigating bias against hedged language.",
    "baseline_results": "Hedged responses scored lower than confident responses across all models evaluated.",
    "validation": "Repeated trials across multiple model architectures to ensure consistency of results."
