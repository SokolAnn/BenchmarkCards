    "limitations": "Given its small size, ASPEN is intended primarily as an evaluation corpus. We mainly focused on three Indo-European languages, namely Russian, German, and Italian. Another limitation concerns the use of the large language model itself which is feasible only with large computational resources. Throughout this paper, we have assumed that the plans are provided to the PLM (i.e., plans are not generated).",

      "Average story length (SentencePiece tokens)",
      "Percentage of stories containing direct speech"
    ],
    "calculation": "MAUVE is computed with GPT-2 and uses gold reference stories in the target language as the set of human-written texts. SentencePiece-ROUGE uses language-independent SentencePiece tokenization. Repetition metrics are measured as proportions of trigrams repeated (intra- and inter-story). Human evaluation uses three annotators per story on a 3-point Likert scale.",
    "interpretation": "For vocabulary-to-token ratio higher is better (less repetitive vocabulary). For intra- and inter-story repetition lower is better. MAUVE measures similarity between distributions of human-written and machine-generated text (higher is better). SentencePiece-ROUGE measures similarity to reference stories. Human ratings: 3 is best, 1 is worst.",
    "baseline_results": "Baselines include mT5-XL (fine-tuned) and Google Translate as an upper bound. The paper reports that Google Translate (upper bound) performs quite well, approaching human parity on some automatic metrics, while mT5 performs poorly on inter-story repetition and ROUGE. (See paper tables for detailed per-model numerical results.)",
    "validation": "Few-shot setup: three plan-story examples per language used as demonstrations; remaining stories in ASPEN treated as test data. Human evaluation: each story evaluated by three native-speaker annotators on Relevance, Fluency, Coherence, and Engagement. Automatic metrics computed against gold reference translations."
