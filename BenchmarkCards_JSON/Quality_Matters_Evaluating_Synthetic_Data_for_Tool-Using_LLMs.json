    "name": "Quality Matters: Evaluating Synthetic Data for Tool-Using LLMs",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper proposes two approaches for assessing the reliability of data for training LLMs to use external tools, including intrinsic quality evaluation criteria and in-context evaluation metrics (ICE). The findings indicate that models trained on high-quality data significantly outperform those trained on unvalidated data, highlighting the importance of data quality in model performance for tool-using LLMs.",
