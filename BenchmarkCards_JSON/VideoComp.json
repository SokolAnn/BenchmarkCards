    "overview": "VideoComp is a benchmark and learning framework for advancing video-text compositionality understanding, focusing on improving vision-language models in fine-grained temporal alignment. It introduces two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp, which assess modelsâ€™ abilities to capture fine-grained, temporally coherent alignment in continuous multi-event video sequences.",
