    ],
    "calculation": "Scores are calculated based on the proportions of demographic attributes generated versus expected demographic distributions.",
    "interpretation": "A higher implicit or explicit bias score indicates a lower level of bias in the model's outputs.",
    "baseline_results": "The benchmark evaluated eight mainstream T2I models and three debiasing methods.",
    "validation": "Human evaluations were conducted to ensure reliability, with trained evaluators assessing the generated images."
