    "goal": "To investigate the interplay between parametric knowledge and contextual knowledge in large language models.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the relationship between parametric knowledge and contextual knowledge, evaluating how well LLMs answered questions requiring both types of knowledge.",
    "interpretation": "Accuracy reflects the model's correct answer rate; memorization ratio indicates how often the model recalls parametric knowledge, and unknown ratio shows the frequency of 'unknown' responses.",
