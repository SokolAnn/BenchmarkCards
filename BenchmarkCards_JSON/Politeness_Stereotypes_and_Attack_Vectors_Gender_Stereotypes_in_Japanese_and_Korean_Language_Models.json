    "name": "Politeness Stereotypes and Attack Vectors: Gender Stereotypes in Japanese and Korean Language Models",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We study how grammatical gender bias relating to politeness levels manifests in Japanese and Korean language models. We analyze relative prediction probabilities of the male and female grammatical genders using templates and find that informal polite speech is most indicative of the female grammatical gender, while rude and formal speech is most indicative of the male grammatical gender. We introduce an attack dataset to (i) identify representational gender bias across politeness levels, (ii) demonstrate how gender biases can be abused to bypass cyberbullying detection models and (iii) show that allocational biases can be mitigated via training on our proposed dataset.",

    "source": "Representational data: verbs taken from standardized language proficiency tests (142 Japanese verbs from JLPT and 107 Korean verbs from TOPIK) combined with template slots (speaker nouns, speaker verb endings, narrator verb endings) to generate sentences. Allocational (attack) data: balanced toxic tweet dataset from Surge AI (professional data labeling platform) which is template-modified by appending gender terms and politeness-level narrator verb forms to generate attack examples.",
    "size": "Representational datasets: 3,852 sentences for Korean and 4,260 sentences for Japanese. Attack dataset: 39,160 sentences total (= (987 - 8) unique tweets × 8 gender terms × (6 - 1) politeness levels). Training (few-shot) set: 392 examples (8 original tweets + 384 template-modified examples). Additional counts: 142 JLPT verbs and 107 TOPIK verbs; 987 original tweets in Surge AI dataset.",

ANOVA (F- and p-tests) used to test whether means across politeness levels differ. F1 scores computed to evaluate cyberbullying detection performance on original, attack, and gender-only test sets.",
    "interpretation": "Negative mean log probability differences (logp(she) - logp(he)) indicate more male-biased predictions (i.e., models prefer 'he' over 'she'). Higher F1 Score indicates better cyberbullying detection performance. Drops in baseline F1 under politeness-level attacks indicate vulnerability; maintenance of high, gender-equal F1 indicates mitigation success.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline cyberbullying model (Shibata et al., 2022) tweets_only F1 = 0.40; proposed SentenceBERT model tweets_only F1 = 0.82. Table 3 in the paper reports F1 scores across politeness and gender terms showing the baseline degrades under attacks while SentenceBERT remains comparatively robust.",
    "validation": "Verified approximate normality and similar variances of log probabilities across politeness levels before applying ANOVA; performed ANOVA tests with reported F and p values. Ensured no overlap between training and evaluation data for few-shot experiments by removing the 8 training tweets from evaluation. Default SetFit parameters were used for few-shot training; training/validation times and hardware reported."
