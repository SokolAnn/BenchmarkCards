    "name": "CTSES (Composite Test Similarity Evaluation Score)",
    "abbreviation": "CTSES",
    "overview": "CTSES is a behavior-preserving, readability-aware metric specifically tailored to evaluate test refactoring. It combines CodeBLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L into a weighted composite metric that balances syntactic accuracy, lexical clarity, and structural alignment.",
