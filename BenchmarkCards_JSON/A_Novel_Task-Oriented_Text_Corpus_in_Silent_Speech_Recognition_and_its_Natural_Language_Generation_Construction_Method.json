    "name": "A Novel Task-Oriented Text Corpus in Silent Speech Recognition and its Natural Language Generation Construction Method",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We construct a novel task-oriented text corpus, which is utilized in the field of silent speech recognition (SSR). In the process of construction, we propose a task-oriented hybrid construction method based on natural language generation algorithm. The algorithm focuses on the strategy of data-to-text generation, and has two advantages including linguistic quality and high diversity (template-based method and deep neural networks respectively). In an SSR experiment with the generated text corpus, analysis results show that the performance of our hybrid construction method outperforms the pure method such as template-based natural language generation or neural natural language generation models.",
