# THRONE

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: THRONE

**Overview**: THRONE is a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) when generating free-form image descriptions.

**Data Type**: Images and text responses

**Domains**:
- Vision-Language
- Image Description

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- POPE
- CHAIR

**Resources**:
- [Resource](COCO dataset)
- [Resource](Objects365 dataset)
- [Resource](Open-source FLAN-T5 models)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in AI and machine learning
- Developers of vision-language models

**Tasks**:
- Evaluate hallucinations in image descriptions generated by LVLMs
- Benchmark different LVLMs on Type I hallucinations

**Limitations**: THRONE focuses solely on measuring Type I hallucinations and does not consider other types of hallucinations.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: COCO and Objects365 datasets

**Size**: COCO validation set: 5000 images; Objects365 validation subset: 5110 images

**Format**: Images and human annotations

**Annotation**: Annotations of objects present in images provided by COCO and Objects365 datasets.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantitative evaluation of hallucinations using Type I and Type II classifications
- Leveraging public language models for evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Overall Precision (PALL)
- Overall Recall (RALL)
- Class-wise Precision (PCLS)
- Class-wise Recall (RCLS)
- F0.5-score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the comparison of predicted object labels from LVLM responses against ground truth data.

**Interpretation**: Higher precision indicates fewer Type I hallucinations in responses.

**Baseline Results**: The paper compares THRONE results with existing benchmarks, showing considerable improvement in precision.

**Validation**: Validated using human oracle evaluations alongside automated methods.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness
- Privacy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Fairness**: Data bias, Output bias
- **Privacy**: Personal information in data, Data privacy rights alignment

**Potential Harm**: Potential for hallucinations leading to misinformation or incorrect conclusions drawn from visual data.

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: THRONE utilizes publicly available datasets ensuring no sensitive personal data is mixed.

**Data Licensing**: Uses publicly available datasets (COCO and Objects365) under their respective licenses.

**Consent Procedures**: Not applicable as the dataset does not involve personal data.

**Compliance With Regulations**: Adheres to ethical standards in AI research and data usage.
