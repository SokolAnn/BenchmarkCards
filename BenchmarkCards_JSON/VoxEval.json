    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Question Answering"

  "data": {
    "source": "The benchmark data is constructed based on the MMLU test set transformed into speech format using the OpenAI Text-to-Speech API.",
    "size": "13,938 unique SpeechQA pairs",
    "format": "Audio",
    "annotation": "Data is generated using text-to-speech transformation."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is computed based on the responses generated by SLMs after converting speech to text using the OpenAI ASR model.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better performance in understanding and responding to spoken questions.",
    "baseline_results": "GLM-4-Voice was the only model that exceeded random guessing, which is an accuracy of 25%.",
    "validation": "Systematic evaluation with several recent SLMs indicates significant challenges posed by VoxEval."
