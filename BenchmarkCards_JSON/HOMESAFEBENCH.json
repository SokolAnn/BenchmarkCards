    "abbreviation": "HOMESAFEBENCH",
    "overview": "HOMESAFEBENCH is a benchmark for evaluating safety inspection performance of embodied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under free exploration with visual feedback. It provides 12,900 dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments, covering five common home safety hazards: fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety.",
