    "metrics": [
      "Spearman correlation"

    "calculation": "Spearman correlation coefficients are computed for critiques based on the consistency with human judgments, ranging from -1 to 1, and normalized to a scale of 0 to 100 for reporting.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Spearman correlation scores indicate greater consistency with human judgments, reflecting better performance in critique evaluation.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline results include evaluations from 35 widely used open-source and closed-source LLMs mentioned in the paper.",
    "validation": "The benchmark is validated through extensive evaluations of multiple LLMs, demonstrating its reliability in evaluating critique ability."
