    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "Xiezhi is a comprehensive, auto-updating evaluation suite designed to assess holistic domain knowledge. Xiezhi comprises 249,587 multiple-choice questions across 516 disciplines (13 categories) and is accompanied by Xiezhi-Specialty (14,041 questions) and Xiezhi-Interdiscipline (10,746 questions). The benchmark is designed for fine-grained domain evaluation and uses a generation-probability-based ranking evaluation.",

    "calculation": "For each question, models assign generative probabilities to all 50 options and options are ranked by probability. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) is computed as the mean of the reciprocal rank of the correct answer. Hit@k is the fraction of queries whose correct answer is ranked in the top k. Mean Rank measures the average rank position of the correct answer divided by the number of options. Accuracy is computed in the conventional way.",
    "interpretation": "MRR closer to 1 indicates the model tends to place the correct answer near the front of the ranking; MRR closer to 0 indicates the correct answer tends to be ranked near the bottom. Hit@k indicates whether correct answer appears in top-k. Higher values indicate better performance. Human baselines (average exam scores) are used for comparison; values above human baseline indicate models exceed average human performance in that domain as reported.",
    "baseline_results": "Random-Guess baseline MRR: 0.089. Example model baseline: GPT-4 MRR reported as 0.402 (0-shot), 0.415 (1-shot), 0.517 (3-shot) in the paper's reported tables.",
    "validation": "Xiezhi-Meta, Xiezhi-Train, Xiezhi-Specialty and Xiezhi-Interdiscipline underwent manual verification. The Annotation Model was evaluated against manual labels using Wrong Rate, Missing Rate, and Error Rate. The English translations of Specialty and Interdiscipline were post-processed and revised by annotators. Human baselines were derived from published average examination scores where available."
