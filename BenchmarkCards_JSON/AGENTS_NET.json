    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "AGENTS NET is a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning that measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a network topology. It evaluates multi-agent systems on fundamental distributed computing problems such as leader election, consensus, maximal matching, and others.",
