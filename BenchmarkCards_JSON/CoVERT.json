    "name": "Covid VERiﬁed Tweet (CoVERT)",
    "abbreviation": "CoVERT",
    "overview": "A fact-checked corpus of tweets focusing on biomedical and COVID-19-related (mis)information. The corpus consists of 300 tweets, each annotated with medical named entities and relations, and each tweet annotated with crowdsourced fact-checking labels (SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION) together with supporting evidence URLs and text snippets. The authors propose a crowdsourcing methodology for collecting fact-checking labels and evidence and demonstrate use of the retrieved evidence in a fact-checking pipeline.",

    "limitations": "Dataset consists of 300 tweets (small size). Crowdsourced verification yields moderate inter-annotator agreement for verification labels (average Cohen's kappa = 0.44). The NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION (NEI) class inherently has no substantiating evidence, making this class challenging for evidence-based approaches. Evidence extracts and verdicts may become outdated as biomedical knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 evolves.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Sampled from an in-house tweet repository using MeSH and frequently occurring medical terms; tweets posted between January 2020 and June 2021 containing mentions of COVID-19 and selected terms (effect, side-effect, vaccine, symptom, treatment) and the lexeme 'caus*'. After filtering and duplicate removal, 300 tweets were randomly sampled for annotation.",
    "size": "300 tweets",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Entities and relations: manual annotation supported by scispaCy with manual revision; entity types: Medical Condition, Treatment, Symptom/Side-effect, Other; relations: cause of, causative agent of, notcause of (UMLS relations). Fact-checking: crowdsourced via Prolific with 3 annotators per tweet; annotators searched the web (Google Search) for credible sources, provided a URL and evidence snippet, and assigned a label (SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION). Majority vote (>=2 annotators) used to adjudicate gold labels. Attention checks and qualification filters were used for crowdworkers; payment and bonus scheme described in paper."

    "calculation": "Acc@k (top-k accuracy) equals 1 if any of the top-k predicted object entities match an object in the gold annotated object list. Inter-annotator F1 for entities computed by treating one annotator's labels as gold and the other's as predictions. Cohen's kappa for verification labels computed per annotation task (10 tweets with 3 annotators) by averaging pairwise kappas across annotator pairs.",
    "interpretation": "Moderate agreement on verification labels (average Cohen's kappa = 0.44) indicates moderate crowd consensus; high inter-annotator F1 for entity annotations (weighted macro average F1 = 0.88) indicates reliable entity annotations after manual revision. Improved F1 for the fact-checking pipeline when using real-world evidence extracts (MLP-Evidence) indicates that external evidence can be more useful than LM-generated evidence.",
    "baseline_results": "Verdict-prediction results: MLP-FEVER on Tweet + LM: Precision 0.60, Recall 0.61, F1 0.60. MLP-FEVER on Tweet + Evidence: Precision 0.61, Recall 0.38, F1 0.46. MLP-Evidence (fine-tuned on CoVERT evidence) on Tweet + Evidence: Precision 0.68, Recall 0.74, F1 0.69. FEVER test results: MLP-FEVER F1 0.49, MLP-Evidence F1 0.46. BioLAMA probing: BERT Acc@1 on SUPPORTS 4.6%, REFUTES 3.62%, NEI 0.0%; BERT Acc@5 reported as well.",
    "validation": "Entity annotation quality: second annotator labeled a random subset of 100 tweets for validation. Fact-checking annotation: each tweet annotated by three crowdworkers; majority vote used as gold label; attention checks included to filter low-quality submissions. For model evaluation, MLP-Evidence fine-tuned using an 80/10/10 train/develop/test split of CoVERT evidence-text pairs."
