    "abbreviation": "CroCoSum",
    "overview": "To study the phenomenon of code-switching in cross-lingual summarization, we introduce CroCoSum, a dataset of cross-lingual code-switched summarization of technology news. It consists of over 24,000 English source articles and 18,000 human-written Chinese news summaries, with more than 92% of the summaries containing code-switched phrases.",

    "goal": "Provide a dataset and benchmark to examine code-switching in cross-lingual summarization and to evaluate baseline approaches (pipeline, end-to-end, zero-shot) on human-written Chinese-English code-switched summaries of English technology news.",

    "limitations": "Baseline experiments are limited by local compute and model sizes. Scope is restricted to topics covered by the data source (technology news). Code-switching in CroCoSum is predominantly in the form of named entities and product/scientific terms; cultural contexts and broader code-switching practices across different linguistic and cultural backgrounds may not be fully encapsulated.",

Original English source articles were obtained from the Internet Archive by following embedded links in posts and retained only if detected as English.",

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Summaries are human-written and reviewed by solidot.org editors prior to publication. For quality validation, 3 bilingual annotators rated a random sample of 20 source-target pairs using Fluency, Coherence, Informativeness and Relevance on a 5-point Likert scale (scores: F: 4.62, C: 4.95, I: 3.97, R: 4.18). Data is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) splits."

      "Code-Mixing Index (CMI)",
      "Intra-Sentence Switch Points (SP)",
      "Average sentence and word counts"
    ],
    "calculation": "ROUGE F1 scores and BERTScore are computed between predicted and ground-truth summaries. Code-Mixing Index (CMI) computed per Gambäck and Das (2016) as fraction of language-dependent tokens not belonging to the matrix language (CMI(x) = (N(x) - max_Li t_Li(x)) / N(x), or 0 if N(x)=0). SP counts word boundaries within a sentence where adjacent words are in different languages. Code-switched percentage is the proportion of sentences containing code-switching spans.",
    "interpretation": "Higher ROUGE and BERTScore indicate greater lexical and semantic similarity to human references. Smaller differences in code-switching metrics (code-switched percentage, CMI, SP) between predictions and gold summaries indicate model outputs more closely resemble human code-switching behavior. N-gram-based automatic metrics may fail to capture semantically correct code-switching choices.",
    "baseline_results": "Best reported baseline: end-to-end finetuned mBART-50 (ROUGE-1: 38.73, ROUGE-2: 20.34, ROUGE-L: 34.35, BERTScore: 58.81). Zero-shot GPT-3 yielded ROUGE-1 26.50 / ROUGE-2 12.33 / ROUGE-L 24.00; GPT-3.5 showed improved scores (ROUGE-1 34.98 / ROUGE-2 17.75 / ROUGE-L 31.17). Pretraining on existing CLS resources (WikiLingua, CrossSum) before finetuning did not improve performance on CroCoSum.",
    "validation": "Dataset split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%). Quality validation: 3 bilingual annotators rated 20 randomly sampled pairs on Fluency, Coherence, Informativeness, and Relevance (5-point Likert). Best model checkpoints selected based on validation performance."
