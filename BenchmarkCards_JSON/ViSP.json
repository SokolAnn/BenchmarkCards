    "name": "ViSP (Vietnamese Sentence Paraphrase Dataset)",
    "abbreviation": "ViSP",
    "overview": "This paper presents ViSP, a high-quality Vietnamese dataset for sentence paraphrasing, consisting of 1.2M originalâ€“paraphrase pairs collected from various domains. The dataset was constructed using a hybrid approach that combines automatic paraphrase generation with manual evaluation to ensure high quality.",
