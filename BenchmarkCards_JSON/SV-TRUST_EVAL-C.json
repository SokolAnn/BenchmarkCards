    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the correct identification of vulnerabilities through structured reasoning and semantic understanding in question-answering tasks.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better reasoning capabilities of the models in vulnerability analysis.",
    "baseline_results": "The results show significant variance across11 evaluated LLMs, with top-performing models scoring below 50% in semantic reasoning tasks.",
    "validation": "The benchmark is validated through extensive testing against known vulnerabilities from the Juliet Test Suite."
