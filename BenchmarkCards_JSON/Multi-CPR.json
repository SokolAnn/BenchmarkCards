    "name": "Multi-CPR: A Multi Domain Chinese Dataset for Passage Retrieval",
    "abbreviation": "Multi-CPR",
    "overview": "We present Multi-CPR, a novel multi-domain Chinese dataset for passage retrieval collected from three different domains (E-commerce, Entertainment video and Medical). Each domain contains around one million passages and human-annotated query-passage related pairs. The dataset is intended to benchmark Chinese passage retrieval in specific domains and to support further research.",

    "source": "Queries and passages sampled from search logs of Alibaba Group search systems: Taobao search (E-commerce), Youku search (Entertainment video), Quark search (Medical). A converted general-domain dataset is constructed from DuReader (Baidu). Positive query-passage pairs are human-annotated.",
    "size": "E-commerce: 100,000 train queries, 1,000 test queries, 1,002,822 passages; Entertainment video: 100,000 train queries, 1,000 test queries, 1,000,000 passages; Medical: 99,999 train queries, 1,000 test queries, 959,526 passages; General-domain (converted from DuReader): 245,897 train queries.",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manual annotation by human annotators. Each sample annotated by at least 5 independent annotators; samples with >80% agreement retained. Annotators passed a pre-annotation test (100–200 samples) reviewed by expert examiners. Expert examiners sample 20% of annotators' data and require an acceptability ratio >=95%."

      "Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10)",

    "calculation": "Following previous work, retrieval performance is evaluated by MRR@10 and Recall@1000. For passage reranking, results are reported using MRR@10. Reranker is trained with a contrastive objective aggregating one positive and multiple negatives per query (contrastive loss formula provided in paper).",
    "interpretation": "Higher MRR@10 and Recall@1000 indicate better retrieval performance. The authors interpret relative improvements in these metrics (e.g., in-domain DPR vs. general-domain DPR, and reranking improvements) as evidence of the value of in-domain labeled data and of reranking.",
    "baseline_results": "Key results reported in the paper (Table 5 & Table 6): Sparse baselines: BM25 MRR@10 — E-commerce 0.2253, Entertainment video 0.2252, Medical 0.1869; Doc2Query MRR@10 — E-commerce 0.2385, Entertainment video 0.2378, Medical 0.2095. Dense baselines: DPR (General BERT) MRR@10 — E-commerce 0.2106, Entertainment video 0.1950, Medical 0.2133. DPR-1 (In-domain BERT) MRR@10 — E-commerce 0.2704, Entertainment video 0.2537, Medical 0.3270. DPR-2 (In-domain BERT-CT) MRR@10 — E-commerce 0.2894, Entertainment video 0.2627, Medical 0.3388. Average MRR@10 over three datasets: BM25 0.2124, DPR-1 0.2837. Reranking (Table 6): BM25 + BERT reranker MRR@10 — E-commerce 0.2784, Entertainment video 0.3212, Medical 0.2673; DPR-1 + BERT reranker MRR@10 — E-commerce 0.3624, Entertainment video 0.3772, Medical 0.3855.",
    "validation": "Annotation quality control: annotators pass pre-annotation tests reviewed by experts; at least 5 annotators per sample and samples with >80% agreement are retained. Experts check 20% of annotators' data and require an acceptability ratio >=95% (annotators revise if below threshold)."
