    "overview": "We introduce MilkQA, a question answering dataset from the dairy domain dedicated to the study of consumer questions. The dataset contains 2,657 pairs of questions and answers, written in the Portuguese language and originally collected by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). The dataset was filtered and anonymized by three human annotators and is intended for research on the answer selection task.",

    "calculation": "P@1 computed by the authors' evaluation script. MAP computed using the official TREC scorer (trec_eval). Answer selection treated as a ranking task where each candidate answer receives a relevance score.",
    "interpretation": "Higher P@1 and MAP indicate better ranking performance. P@1 is the fraction of questions with a correct answer ranked first. MAP measures how well a system places correct answers near the top across the rank list. The authors interpret, for example, P@1 = 0.57 as only 57% of questions correctly answered and indicative of room for improvement.",
    "baseline_results": "Results on WikiQA and MilkQA (P@1 and MAP): WWM — WikiQA P@1 0.5062 MAP 0.5100; MilkQA P@1 0.2467 MAP 0.3836.

CNN-LDC — WikiQA P@1 0.5485 MAP 0.6848; MilkQA P@1 0.5700 MAP 0.6899.",
    "validation": "Dataset partitioned into train/dev/test subsets with 2,307 training questions, 50 development questions, and 300 test questions. Candidate answer pools of 50 answers were constructed with one ground truth per pool. MAP computed with trec_eval; early stopping on the dev set used during model training."
