    "name": "Taskmaster-1",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "Introduces the Taskmaster-1 dataset: 13,215 task-based dialogs across six domains, collected via two procedures (two-person Wizard of Oz spoken dialogs and self-dialog written dialogs). Dialogs are labeled with API calls and arguments (API-oriented annotation). The dataset aims to provide realistic and diverse goal-oriented conversational data and includes baseline model evaluations and human judgments.",

    "goal": "Provide a high-quality, diverse corpus of goal-oriented conversational data to support data-driven dialog system research, development and design.",

      "Response Generation",
      "Argument Prediction"
    ],
    "limitations": "Self-dialogs cannot fully recreate disfluencies and other complex error patterns seen in two-person spoken dialogs; two-person (WOz) collection is time-consuming, complex and expensive compared to self-dialog collection.",

  },
  "data": {
    "source": "Collected via two methods: two-person Wizard of Oz (WOz) spoken dialogs pairing trained agents (assistant role) with crowdsourced workers (user role), and self-dialogs where crowdsourced workers wrote entire dialogs. Covers six domains: ordering pizza, creating auto repair appointments, setting up ride service, ordering movie tickets, ordering coffee drinks, making restaurant reservations.",
    "size": "13,215 dialogs (5,507 spoken dialogs, 7,708 written dialogs)",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Dialogs annotated with API calls and API arguments (arguments annotated as spans in utterances) and transaction status markers ('.accept' or '.reject'); complete list of labels included with corpus release."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated evaluation metrics (Perplexity, BLEU Score)",

    "calculation": "Perplexity and BLEU computed on model outputs evaluated on test sets. Human evaluation: ranking and 1-5 Likert ratings performed on 500 partial dialogs with 3 crowdsourced workers per item (averaged). Micro F1 computed for API argument prediction (arguments annotated as spans).",
    "interpretation": "Lower Perplexity and higher BLEU indicate better response generation performance. BLEU correlates with human ranking judgments. Higher human Likert ratings indicate better perceived appropriateness (1-5 scale, higher is better).",
    "baseline_results": "Response generation baselines (self-dialog corpus): Transformer PPL 18.19, BLEU 6.11, human rating (Likert) 3.22, rank 1; LSTM-attention PPL 20.05, BLEU 5.12, human rating 3.51, rank 2; Convolution PPL 21.25, BLEU 5.09, human rating 2.89, rank 3. API argument prediction: Transformer Micro F1 48.73%; Transformer + copy Micro F1 51.79%.",
    "validation": "Dataset validated via quantitative comparisons with MultiWOZ (vocabulary, utterance statistics, perplexity/BLEU) and via human evaluations (500 dialogs Ã— 3 annotations). Reported inter-annotator reliability (Krippendorff's Alpha): Rating 0.21, Ranking 0.29."
