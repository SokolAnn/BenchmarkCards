    "abbreviation": "VRDU",
    "overview": "We identify the desiderata for a more comprehensive benchmark and propose one we call Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU). VRDU contains two datasets that represent several challenges: rich schema including diverse data types as well as hierarchical entities, complex templates including tables and multi-column layouts, and diversity of different layouts (templates) within a single document type. We design few-shot and conventional experiment settings along with a carefully designed matching algorithm to evaluate extraction results. We open-source the dataset with high-quality OCR results and annotations and an evaluation toolkit with a type-aware matching algorithm.",

    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manual annotation by human annotators (30 annotators) with expert review (3 experts). Token-level annotations with bounding boxes, token indices, entity category labels, BIO-style token labeling and hierarchical grouping for hierarchical entities.

    "calculation": "Predictions are compared to ground-truth using a type-aware fuzzy matching algorithm that applies entity-type-specific matching functions (e.g., numeric conversion for price values, standardized date parsing for date strings) before computing F1 scores. Both micro-F1 and macro-F1 are reported.",
    "interpretation": "Micro-F1 weighs every instance equally (instance-level performance) while macro-F1 averages F1 across entity types. Lower micro-F1 relative to macro-F1 on Ad-buy Forms indicates poor performance on hierarchical/repeated entities. Higher scores indicate better extraction performance; differences across tasks (STL/MTL/UTL) measure template generalization.",
    "baseline_results": "The paper reports baseline results for LayoutLM, LayoutLMv2, LayoutLMv3, and FormNet across tasks and training sizes (|D| = 10, 50, 100, 200). Example results at |D|=200: Registration Form (Single Template) micro-F1 — LayoutLM: 90.47, LayoutLMv2: 91.41, LayoutLMv3: 90.89, FormNet: 92.12. Registration Form (Unseen Template) micro-F1 — LayoutLM: 70.47, LayoutLMv2: 72.03, LayoutLMv3: 62.58, FormNet: 77.29. Ad-buy Form (Mixed Template) micro-F1 at |D|=200 — LayoutLM: 44.66, LayoutLMv2: 46.54, LayoutLMv3: 45.16, FormNet: 43.23. (All numbers taken from Table 4 in the paper.)",
    "validation": "Prescribed dataset splits include 300 documents in the testing set for each task. For training, four sizes are provided (10, 50, 100, 200). Under each setting, three training sets with different random seeds are built and reported results are the average over the three runs."
