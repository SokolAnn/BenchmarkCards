    "name": "AGENT SAFE",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "AGENT SAFE is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the safety of embodied VLM agents under hazardous instructions, featuring a risk-aware instruction dataset and evaluating agents across perception, planning, and action stages using 45 adversarial scenarios and 1,350 hazardous tasks.",

    "calculation": "The metrics are evaluated through a three-stage evaluation process: perception, planning, and action.",
    "interpretation": "Higher values in metrics like Planning Success Rate and Execution Success Rate indicate better performance, while lower values in Planning Rejection Rate indicate a reluctance to accept harmful commands.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "The benchmark is validated through extensive experiments to reveal vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms."
