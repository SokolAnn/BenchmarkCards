    "abbreviation": "GEAK",
    "overview": "GEAK is a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD Instinct â„¢MI300X and MI250. We introduce two benchmark suites for evaluating AI-generated Triton kernels, enabling measurement of both execution correctness and runtime performance of generated kernels.",
