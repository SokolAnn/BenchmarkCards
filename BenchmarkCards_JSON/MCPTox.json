    "overview": "MCPTox is the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate Tool Poisoning Attacks within the real-world Model Context Protocol ecosystem. It enables a standardized and realistic evaluation of agent robustness against Tool Poisoning attacks, featuring 1312 malicious test cases generated from 353 authentic tools across 45 live MCP servers.",

    "calculation": "Attack Success Rate is calculated as the number of successful attacks divided by the total number of valid outputs.",
    "interpretation": "An ASR approaching 100% indicates a high vulnerability to Tool Poisoning; lower values suggest better resilience.",
    "baseline_results": "Highest attack success rate observed was 72.8% for specific LLM models.",
    "validation": "Validated against real-world MCP servers ensuring realistic evaluation conditions."
