    "overview": "BIDWESH is the first multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type, and target group, providing a linguistically rich and inclusive resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla.",
