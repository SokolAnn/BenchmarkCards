    "name": "MUTANT: A Multi-sentential Code-mixed Hinglish Dataset",
    "abbreviation": "MUTANT",
    "overview": "We propose a novel task of identifying multi-sentential code-mixed text (MCT) from multilingual articles and build a first-of-its-kind multi-sentential code-mixed Hinglish dataset (MUTANT). The MUTANT dataset comprises 67k articles with 85k identified Hinglish MCTs. We propose a token-level language-aware pipeline, extend the code-mixing index to a multi-sentential framework, and make the dataset publicly available to facilitate future research.",

    "limitations": "•Contrary to the previous works, all the data sources comprises the non social media sites. This could potentially limit the diversity in the code-mixed text as observed on social media platforms.\n•In the current form, the dataset is limited to only one code-mixed language. We believe the proposed technique to extract MCT could be expanded to other code-mixed languages in the future.\n•The data sources could potentially have their own biases (topical, style of writing, etc). We expect future works to be cautious while generalizing the results obtained on this dataset.",

    "calculation": "Accuracy: (number of correct MCT and non-MCT predictions / total number of MST) * 100. FMR (False MCT Rate): ratio of incorrectly identified MCT to total number of actual monolingual MST, reported as percent. D@10 (Diversity@10): percentage of articles in a data source having more than 10% correctly identified MCT. CMI: as defined in Equation (1) in the paper measuring degree of code-mixing per text (ranges 0-100). Sentence-level CMI and Multilinguality Ratio (MR) are combined; thresholds for CMI (β) and MR (φ) selected by grid search on SAnD.",
    "interpretation": "High Accuracy (%) is preferred. Low FMR (%) is preferred. High D@10 (%) is preferred. Low CMI indicates prevalence of a single language; high CMI indicates high degree of code-mixing. Sentence-level CMI > β labels a sentence as code-mixed; MR > φ labels an MST as code-mixed.",
    "baseline_results": "The Multi data source generalization (MDG) threshold generalization technique yields consistently better trade-offs with higher accuracy and lower FMR across datasets compared to mean-based generalization techniques (LA, GA, ALG), as reported in Tables 6-8; the paper states MDG 'satisfies both conditions with low FMR and high accuracy on all the datasets'.",
    "validation": "Thresholds (β and φ) were selected via grid search on the small annotated dataset SAnD (120 articles, 568 MSTs). Performance of the MCT identification pipeline and generalization techniques was evaluated on subsets of SAnD (Dspeech, Dnews, Dspeech + Dnews). Qualitative validation was performed by two independent human evaluators on a random sample (5 articles from each source) reporting complete agreement and Cohen's kappa scores."
