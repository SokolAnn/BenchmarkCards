    "overview": "RealVideoQuest is a benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded user queries. It consists of 7.5K user queries with video response intents sourced from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage retrieval and refinement process.",
