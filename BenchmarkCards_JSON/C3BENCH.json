    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated using established methods: accuracy for classification and retrieval, F1 score for NER and punctuation, and BLEU score for translation.",
    "interpretation": "An accuracy of 1 is given for a correct classification; F1 score is calculated for NER and punctuation tasks; BLEU score is used for translation.",
    "baseline_results": "Existing LLMs struggled with classical Chinese understanding tasks, scoring below 50 average accuracy across evaluations.",
    "validation": "Extensive evaluations of 15 representative models conducted using C3bench to quantify their capabilities in Classical Chinese understanding."
