    "abbreviation": "K-DECORE",
    "overview": "K-DECORE is a novel framework for Continual Structured Knowledge Reasoning (CSKR) that addresses various challenges of catastrophic forgetting and parameter growth across heterogeneous structured knowledge environments by leveraging knowledge decoupling, enabling efficient knowledge transfer across diverse tasks.",

      "ML Researchers",
      "Industry Practitioners"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Structured Knowledge Reasoning"

  "data": {
    "source": "Four structured knowledge reasoning benchmarks curated for experimental tasks.",
    "size": "4 datasets",
    "format": "Various formats depending on the dataset (e.g., JSON, SQL queries for DB reasoning, SPARQL queries for KG reasoning)",
    "annotation": "The data has been extracted from structured knowledge benchmarks."

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the accuracy scores from various tasks before and after training.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better performance while lower forgetting rates (BWT) and higher knowledge transfer (FWT) suggest more effective continual learning.",
    "baseline_results": "K-DECORE shows superior performance compared to multiple state-of-the-art continual learning methods.",
    "validation": "Extensive experiments conducted over multiple metrics across different structured knowledge reasoning tasks."
