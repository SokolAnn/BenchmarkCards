    "name": "English Resume Corpus",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "Transforms resume information extraction into a sentence classification task; improves classification rules to create a larger and more fine-grained English resume classification dataset and uses it to test mainstream pre-trained language models and study the relationship between training sample size and accuracy.",

    "goal": "Create a larger, more fine-grained English resume classification dataset by improving annotation rules; evaluate mainstream pre-trained language models on this dataset; and examine how training sample size affects model correctness.",
    "audience": [],
    "tasks": [
      "Text Classification",
      "Information Extraction"
    ],
    "limitations": "The constructed resume corpus is highly sample-imbalanced across categories (e.g., Experience accounts for ~50% while Qualifications, Object, and Skill are 1%â€“7%); sample imbalance remains a limitation to be addressed in future work.",

    "source": "Original CVs from Kaggle (referenced Kaggle datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oo7kartik/resume-text-batch and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chingkuangkam/resume-text-classification-dataset) and prior English resume dataset (Gan and Takahashi, 2021).",
    "size": "1,000 resumes; 78,000 sentences total (split into 58,000 training, 10,000 validation, 10,000 test).",
    "format": "TXT (segmented sentence-level records; each annotated resume exported as a separate txt file).",
    "annotation": "Manual sentence-level annotation using a custom Tkinter annotation tool with rule-based sentence segmentation and manual label selection. Seven labels: Experience, Personal Information, Summary, Education, Qualifications, Skill, Object."

    "methods": [
      "Model-based evaluation: fine-tuning pre-trained language models (BERT large, ALBERT xxlarge, RoBERTa large, T5 large)",
      "Automated metrics evaluation (F1-micro)",
      "Training-sample-size ablation (varying training samples and measuring performance)",
      "Repeated runs (each experiment performed 3 times and averaged)"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "F1 Score (micro)"
    ],
    "calculation": "Datasets randomly split in ratio 7:1.5:1.5 (training:validation:test). For each experimental setting, runs were repeated three times and F1-micro scores averaged.",
    "interpretation": "Increasing the number of training samples increases model correctness; models reach maximum performance around 40,000 training samples. The newly constructed corpus yields higher F1 compared to the original dataset (e.g., +0.70% for BERT).",
    "baseline_results": "BERT* large (baseline): 85.97; BERT large: 86.67; ALBERT large: 86.40; RoBERTa large: 87.00; T5 large: 87.35.",
    "validation": "Random 7:1.5:1.5 split with experiments repeated three times and averaged. Confusion matrix analysis was used to analyze per-category learning (e.g., RoBERTa and T5 confusion matrices)."
