    "abbreviation": "JamPatoisNLI",
    "overview": "JamPatoisNLI provides the first dataset for natural language inference in a creole language, Jamaican Patois. JamPatoisNLI, which consists of naturally-occurring premises and expert-written hypotheses, is a step towards steering research into a traditionally underserved language and a useful benchmark for understanding cross-lingual NLP.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "Provide the first natural language inference dataset in Jamaican Patois to serve as a benchmark for studying cross-lingual transfer to creole and low-resource languages and to encourage research on NLP for Jamaican Patois and creole languages.",

      "Natural Language Inference"

    "limitations": "The dataset is small: 650 examples in total with relatively small validation and test splits compared to high-resource language datasets; limited availability of native speakers constrained dataset size (explicitly stated in the paper).",

  },
  "data": {
    "source": "Premises drawn from naturally occurring written Jamaican Patois: Twitter (634 examples), Anthology: Shelley Sykes-Coley (6 examples), Poetry: Rt. Hon. Dr. Louise Bennett-Coverley (4 examples), Online blog (6 examples). The paper also states remaining examples drawn from a cultural website (jamaicans.com).",
    "size": "650 examples (250 training, 200 development, 200 test)",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Hypotheses were manually written by the first author (a fluent/native speaker). Labels (entailment, neutral, contradiction) were assigned following MNLI/ANLI-style criteria. A random sample of 100 sentence pairs (evenly distributed across classes) was double-annotated by volunteer fluent speakers for validation (Fleiss Kappa 88.99%)."

    "calculation": "Accuracy reported as percentage of correct label predictions; experiment results averaged over three runs with different random seeds (and standard deviation reported for best model across ten experiments). Fleiss Kappa computed on 100 double-annotated examples (88.99%).",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy indicates more effective cross-lingual transfer. The authors interpret higher few-shot and zero-shot accuracies on JamPatoisNLI (relative to AmericasNLI) as evidence that relatedness to English boosts transfer effectiveness. RoBERTa-based models outperform BERT-based models in these experiments.",
    "baseline_results": "Majority baseline: 33.50%. Best BERT-based results on full few-shot JamPatoisNLI: bert-uncased-unfrozen 66.17%; mbert-uncased-unfrozen 65.33%. Best RoBERTa-based results on full few-shot JamPatoisNLI: roberta-unfrozen 76.50%; xlm-unfrozen 75.17%. Zero-shot roberta-unfrozen: 67.50%. For AmericasNLI best zero-shot: 42.00%.",
    "validation": "100 examples were double-annotated by volunteer fluent speakers; Fleiss Kappa = 88.99% and percentage accuracy = 89.00% on that sample. Experimental results averaged across three seeds; standard deviation reported for best model across ten runs (1.43% on test set for xlm-unfrozen)."
