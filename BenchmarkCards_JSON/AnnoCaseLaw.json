    "overview": "AnnoCaseLaw is a dataset of 471 meticulously annotated U.S. Appeals Court negligence cases designed for Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). It includes expert-labeled annotations that highlight key components of judicial decision making, as well as relevant legal concepts. The dataset aims to improve explainability in LJP models and establish a performance baseline using leading large language models.",
