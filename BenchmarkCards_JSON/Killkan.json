    "overview": "This paper presents Killkan, the first dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the Kichwa language, an indigenous language of Ecuador. The dataset contains approximately 4 hours of audio with transcription, translation into Spanish, and morphosyntactic annotation in the format of Universal Dependencies.",

    "source": "The audio data was retrieved from a publicly available radio program",

    "metrics": [
      "Character Error Rate (CER)",
      "Word Error Rate (WER)",
      "Word Information Lost (WIL)"

    "calculation": "CER, WER, and WIL are calculated based on the discrepancies between predicted and actual transcriptions.",
    "interpretation": "A lower CER and WER indicate better performance in transcribing the ASR output.",
    "baseline_results": "Latest model achieved 2.04% CER on the test set.",
    "validation": "The dataset was fine-tuned against different sample sizes to test its performance across various levels of resource availability."
