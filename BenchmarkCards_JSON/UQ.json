    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the performance of AI models on the UQ dataset, including evaluation metrics established by LLM validators and subsequent human reviews.",
    "interpretation": "High scores indicate strong performance on difficult unsolved questions reflective of real-world tasks; low scores indicate challenges remaining in modeling such questions.",
    "baseline_results": "Initial human evaluations identified that top-performing models passed validation on only 15% of questions.",
    "validation": "The benchmark allows continuous updates and validations through community engagement and feedback."
