    "calculation": "Metrics calculated by comparing the translation outputs against reference translations using COMET and BLEU scores.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate better translation quality, while lower scores reflect poorer performance, specifically assessing gender bias.",
    "baseline_results": "The experimental results show up to 10 COMET points lower for non-binary identities compared to binary gender contexts.",
    "validation": "Evaluated through human judgment and consistency checks (Kappa coefficient > 0.8)."
