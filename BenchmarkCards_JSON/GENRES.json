    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on model's output disparities between male and female representative character profiles.",
    "interpretation": "A positive score on bias metrics indicates male-favoring bias, while a negative score indicates female-favoring bias.",
    "baseline_results": "Using six MLLMs, results reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases.",
    "validation": "The benchmark is validated by applying the metrics across multiple models and evaluating the consistency of bias patterns."
