    "overview": "CC-Riddle is a large-scale question answering dataset of Chinese character riddles covering the majority of common simplified Chinese characters. It is constructed by web crawling human-written riddles, generating additional riddles with a fine-tuned BART model, and manual filtering, and is intended to evaluate language models' ability to solve Chinese character riddles (single-character solutions) that require glyph, meaning and pronunciation understanding.",

    "goal": "To propose and release the first large-scale, high-coverage QA dataset of Chinese character riddles (CC-Riddle) to evaluate language models' ability to solve character riddles requiring glyph, commonsense and figurative language understanding, and to provide a resource for research on Chinese characters and figurative language.",

    "limitations": "The authors note several limitations: BLEU is of limited usefulness for evaluating riddle generation because many reasonable riddle descriptions need not be lexically similar to references; some common characters are missing because generated riddles for them were rejected during filtering; pinyin/pronunciation-based riddles are rare in human-written data and were not taken into consideration in generation without special processing.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Web-crawled human-written Chinese character riddles from multiple websites and model-generated riddles produced by a fine-tuned Chinese BART model using input glyph (from IDS dictionary and HanziCraft), pinyin and meaning (from Chinese Xinhua Dictionary); generated candidates were manually filtered by human annotators.",
    "size": "27,517 unique riddles; covers 7,279 characters. Split by characters: training 16,626 riddles (4,367 characters), validation 5,480 riddles (1,457 characters), test 5,411 riddles (1,455 characters). Generated riddles after filtering: 7,132.",

    "calculation": "Accuracy: computed as top-1 correctness for retrieval-based, generative and multiple-choice QA. Retrieval model trained with multiple negatives ranking loss; top-1 returned candidate evaluated for accuracy. Generative QA: model outputs processed with regular expressions to extract the answer; BLEU-4 and distinct n-gram counts computed on top-1 generation outputs (BLEU reported on 100 test characters for generation evaluation). Distinct unigrams and bigrams counted to assess diversity.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy indicates better riddle-solving. The authors report that multiple-choice QA is the easiest, retrieval-based QA is harder, and generative QA is the most challenging (comparable to manual test). BLEU-4 is limited as reference diversity makes lexical similarity a poor proxy for quality; distinct n-gram counts measure diversity of generated riddles. Supplementary glyph and definition information improves retrieval performance, with glyphs especially useful.",

Generative QA: ChatGPT accuracy 0.0039 (all), ChatGLM accuracy 0.0013 (all). Multiple-choice QA: ChatGPT random-distractors accuracy 0.4153 (all); ChatGPT similar-distractors accuracy 0.4016 (all); ChatGLM random 0.2706, similar 0.2277 (all). Manual annotation on 100 samples: Annotator A accuracy 0.38, Annotator B 0.18, Annotator C 0.65. Generation evaluation (top-1 BLEU-4 on 100 tested characters): Ours 3.87, Template-based 4.67, Replacement-based 29.33.

Generated candidates were manually filtered with two annotators per candidate and a third annotator resolving disagreements; human evaluation conducted on 100 randomly sampled test entries with three annotators."
