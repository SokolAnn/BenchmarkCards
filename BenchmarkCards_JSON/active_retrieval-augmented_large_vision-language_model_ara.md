# Active Retrieval-Augmented Large Vision-Language Model (ARA)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Active Retrieval-Augmented Large Vision-Language Model (ARA)

**Overview**: The ARA framework is designed to mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by using active retrieval mechanisms to provide external knowledge during the generation process. It implements a coarse-to-fine retrieval method to enhance the model's accuracy in responding to visual queries.

**Data Type**: Visual and Textual Data

**Domains**:
- Vision-Language Models
- Image Comprehension
- Hallucination Mitigation

- Researchers in AI and machine learning
- Developers working with vision-language models

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Image Captioning

**Limitations**: N/A

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- General-purpose language processing tasks
- Extremely high-dimensional retrieval settings

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Multiple datasets including MSCOCO, A-OKVQA, GQA, VisualGenome

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: Image and text pairs

**Annotation**: The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, specifically focusing on hallucination detection.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Coarse-grained retrieval
- Fine-grained retrieval
- Active retrieval techniques (Confidence-aware, Query-aware, Image-aware)

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated by matching the model outputs against ground truths in the evaluation datasets.
