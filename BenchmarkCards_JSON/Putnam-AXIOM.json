    "abbreviation": "Putnam-AXIOM",
    "overview": "Putnam-AXIOM is a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, designed to assess advanced mathematical reasoning in large language models. Additionally, it includes Putnam-AXIOM Variation, which consists of 100 functional variants generated through perturbation techniques to create contamination-resilient test cases.",
