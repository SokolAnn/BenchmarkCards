    "goal": "To propose and establish a novel benchmark for classical Chinese natural language understanding by redesigning, creating and collecting nine classical Chinese NLP tasks to evaluate and analyze NLP models.",

      "NLP researchers",

      "Text Classification",
      "Token Similarity",

    ],
    "limitations": "Lacking expertise knowledge and data; small dataset sizes for some tasks (e.g., XuCi); GJC category rule not certified by authoritative experts; lack of a diagnostic dataset; evaluated baseline models are primarily BERT/RoBERTa style and lack variety.",
    "out_of_scope_uses": []

  "data": {
    "source": "Mix of sources as stated in the paper: Daizhige corpus, authoritative historical texts and Buddhist scriptures, examination papers, idiom dictionary, GLNER (GULIAN 2020) competition dataset, FSPC (THU-FSPC), and collected online modern-classical parallel translations.",
    "size": "Per Table 1 (Train / Dev / Test examples): PUNC: 90,000 / 20,000 / 20,000 examples; TLC: 28,000 / 6,000 / 6,000 examples; GJC: 100,000 / 20,000 / 20,000 examples; XuCi: 800 / 200 / 200 examples; WYWRC: 3,000 / 500 / 500 examples; IRC: 3,000 / 1,000 / 1,000 examples; WYWMT: 20,000 / 3,000 / 3,000 examples; GLNER: 80,000 / 18,000 / 18,000 examples; FSPC: 3,000 / 1,000 / 1,000 examples.",
    "format": "Mixture of formats as stated: JSON (WYWRC, GLNER, FSPC, IRC), TSV (PUNC sequence-pair TSV, TLC TSV, WYWMT TSV, Xuci TSV), text–category format for GJC (text–category), and other TSV/JSON as described per task.",
    "annotation": "Annotators are volunteer students and scholars; processes include data collection, extracting, proofreading, double-checking between annotators, and final review by domain experts. For exam-paper-derived tasks annotators copy or OCR questions and proofread; quality checks applied (e.g., WYWMT filtering and sample length limit 5–200 characters).

    "calculation": "Standard task-specific metrics are used: F1 for sequence labeling, Accuracy for classification and multiple-choice reading comprehension, BLEU/chrF2/TER/ROUGE for machine translation. For experiments, each model is fine-tuned with 3 runs and the model with the best development score is used for testing.",
    "interpretation": "Higher metric values indicate better performance; human evaluation results are reported as upper bounds. The paper notes a significant gap between models and human performance and reports that larger models and more pretraining data/steps tend to perform better.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline results reported in the paper (examples): Table 2 - Human average 88.0; DeBERTa-base average 75.9; other model averages include GuwenBERT-base 72.9, GuwenBERT-large 75.6. Per-task metrics shown in Table 2. WYWMT (Table 3) BLEU scores: Human 45.6, guwenbert-base 40.1, DeBERTa-base 39.5, guwenbert-large 38.8.",
    "validation": "Validation procedure: 3 training runs per model; select model with best development score for testing. Human performance measured by sampling (extract 30 samples in training phase, sample 100 items from the test set) and aggregating three annotators' results. Cross double-checking and expert final review were applied during annotation."
