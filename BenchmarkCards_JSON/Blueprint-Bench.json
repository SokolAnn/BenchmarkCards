    "calculation": "Scores are calculated based on the similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans by evaluating room connectivity, size rank, and other components.",
    "interpretation": "A score of 1 indicates a perfect match, while a score of 0 indicates no similarity.",
    "baseline_results": "Human performance serves as a baseline, with AI models typically performing at or below a random baseline.",
    "validation": "Blueprint-Bench will continue to be updated with new models and community submissions for ongoing evaluation."
