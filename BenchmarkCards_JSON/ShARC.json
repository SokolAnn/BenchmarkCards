    "name": "ShARC (Shaping Answers with Rules through Conversation)",
    "abbreviation": "ShARC",
    "overview": "A dataset for the task of conversational machine reading: given an input question, a supporting rule text snippet, a scenario (context) and a dialog history, predict the answer (YES / NO / IRRELEVANT) or, if necessary, generate a follow-up question. The paper formalises the task, develops a crowdsourcing annotation protocol, and provides a corpus of over 32k conversational machine reading utterances from real-world rules.",

    "limitations": "The authors note the dataset size may be insufficient for training end-to-end neural models (\"One may argue that the size of the dataset is not sufficient for training end-to-end neural models\"). They also state that the data \"is biased in the sense that when a scenario is given, at least one of the follow-up questions in a dialog can be answered\", and they report measured annotation/noise rates for negative sampling and other sources (see Appendix B and D).",

    "calculation": "For classification tasks the paper uses micro- and macro- averaged accuracies. For follow-up question generation BLEU scores (orders 1,2,3,4) are computed between gold follow-up questions and model-predicted follow-up questions. Annotator agreement is measured with Fleiss' Kappa and Cohen's Kappa. Human accuracy on the classification sub-task is computed using a methodology where the second annotator's answer is considered the prediction and the majority vote is taken as ground truth (following Rajpurkar et al., 2016).",
    "interpretation": "Higher micro/macro accuracy indicates better classification performance; higher BLEU indicates closer match to gold follow-up questions. The paper reports a human classification accuracy of 93.9% and notes that baseline models achieve substantially lower scores, indicating substantial room for improvement, especially on macro accuracy and scenario interpretation.",

Human accuracy (classification sub-task) reported as 93.9%.",
    "validation": "Multiple validation procedures: re-annotation of irregular dialog tree nodes, annotator validation of previous dialog parts, qualification tests for workers, restrict worker location and approval-rate thresholds, validation sampling to compute worker quality scores, expert validation of sampled annotations, and manual curation of development and test instances prone to errors. The paper reports agreement figures and measured noise rates for various negative sampling procedures in Appendix B and D."
