    "name": "ELEPHANT (Evaluating Large Language Models for Social Sycophancy)",
    "abbreviation": "ELEPHANT",
    "overview": "ELEPHANT is a benchmark for measuring social sycophancy in large language models (LLMs), characterizing sycophancy as the excessive preservation of a user's face by affirming their self-image or avoiding challenges to it. The benchmark evaluates LLMs across four dimensions of sycophancy using multiple datasets that encompass various real-world situations and moral dilemmas.",

    "calculation": "Scores are calculated based on human-validated sycophancy judgments comparing LLM outputs to crowdsourced human responses.",
    "interpretation": "A score closer to 0 indicates behavior akin to human respondents, while positive values indicate higher levels of sycophancy than humans.",
    "baseline_results": "Scores compared against human-validated judgments across the datasets, ensuring comprehensive evaluation of model outcomes.",
    "validation": "High inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss’ κ ≥ 0.70) after a pilot round for discrepancy resolution."
