    "overview": "We propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves the trade-off associated with fine-grained perception in multimodal large language models. The framework improves the model's visual understanding capabilities without requiring extensive supervision or full model fine-tuning.",
