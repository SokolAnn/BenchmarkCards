    "name": "Larth: Dataset and Machine Translation for Etruscan",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We propose a dataset for machine translation from Etruscan to English, which contains 2891 translated examples from existing academic sources. This dataset can help enable future research on this language and similar low-resource languages.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To create a usable corpus from Etruscan inscriptions for natural language processing and evaluate neural models for translation from Etruscan to English.",

      "ML Researchers",
      "Linguists",
      "NLP Practitioners"

  "data": {
    "source": "The dataset includes Etruscan texts extracted from academic resources such as ETP, CIEP, and Zikh Rasna.",
    "size": "2,891 examples",
    "format": "CSV",
    "annotation": "Data is manually and automatically annotated, with translations provided for each example."

    "methods": [
      "Neural machine translation",

    "metrics": [
      "BLEU",
      "chr-F",
      "TER"
    ],
    "calculation": "Metrics are computed based on n-grams matching between the machine-translated and reference translations.",
    "interpretation": "Higher BLEU and chr-F scores indicate better translation quality, while lower TER scores indicate fewer edits needed.",
    "baseline_results": "A small transformer model achieved a BLEU score of 10.1 on the dataset.",
    "validation": "The training and validation splits are created from the available examples, typically using an 80/20 split."
