    "abbreviation": "LLMGeo",
    "overview": "We present a new dataset, exclusively sourced from Google Street View, designed to challenge Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) through real-world, in-the-wild random images. This dataset is intended to serve as a robust benchmark for assessing these modelsâ€™ ability to identify image locations accurately.",
