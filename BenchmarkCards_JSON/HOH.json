    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated by evaluating LLM responses as 'perfect', 'missing', or 'harmful'.",
    "interpretation": "A response is considered 'perfect' if it accurately answers the question without errors.",
    "baseline_results": "Llama-70B achieved only a modest score of 51.7% on the benchmark.",
    "validation": "Extensive experiments reveal the significant impact of outdated information on RAG performance."
