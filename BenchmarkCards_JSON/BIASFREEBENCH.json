    "name": "BIASFREEBENCH",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "BIASFREEBENCH is an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques for large language models (LLMs) on two test scenarios: multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA. It reorganizes existing datasets into a unified query-response setting and introduces a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to evaluate fairness, safety, and anti-stereotypical behavior of LLM responses.",

      "Bias-Free Score"
    ],
    "calculation": "Bias-Free Score is calculated by measuring the proportion of responses that are safe, fair, and anti-stereotypical compared to biased responses.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Bias-Free Score indicates better bias mitigation effectiveness. A score of 1 means no bias present, while a score approaching 0 indicates high levels of bias.",
    "baseline_results": "N/A",
    "validation": "Evaluated against benchmarks like BBQ and FairMT-Bench with majority voting for consistency."
