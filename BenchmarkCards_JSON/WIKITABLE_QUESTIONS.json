    "goal": "To evaluate and train semantic parsers that answer complex, compositional questions using semi-structured HTML tables as the knowledge source, learned from question-table-answer triples.",
    "audience": [],
    "tasks": [
      "Question Answering",
      "Semantic Parsing"
    ],
    "limitations": "Authors state that 21% of examples cannot be answered using any logical form generated from the current deduction rules. Annotation artifacts and unhandled question types (e.g., yes-no questions, phrases like \"same\" or \"consecutive\"), complex cell formats, and incorrect annotations are noted in Section 7.4. Approximately 69% of the questions remain after answer-agreement filtering.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Randomly selected HTML tables from Wikipedia (tables with at least 8 rows and 5 columns); question-answer pairs authored and validated via Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
    "size": "22,033 question-answer pairs on 2,108 HTML tables (20% of tables held out as test set)",
    "format": "HTML tables (preprocessed: non-textual contents omitted; merged cells unmerged and duplicated into unmerged cells)",
    "annotation": "Two-stage Amazon Mechanical Turk: (1) workers wrote trivia questions about each table using one of 36 generic prompts; (2) separate workers answered each question based on the table. Answers were kept only if agreed upon by at least two workers; approximately 69% of questions remain after this filtering."

    "methods": [
      "Automated evaluation (Accuracy, Oracle score)",
      "Comparison to baselines (IR baseline, WQ baseline)",

    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy",
      "Oracle score"

    "calculation": "Accuracy: number of examples (x,t,y) on which the system outputs the correct answer y. Oracle score: number of examples where at least one generated candidate logical form z in Z_x executes to y.",
    "interpretation": "Accuracy measures final output correctness; oracle score measures whether a correct logical form was generated among candidates (an upper bound on generation coverage).",
    "baseline_results": "On test data: IR baseline accuracy 12.7% (oracle 70.6%), WQ baseline accuracy 24.3% (oracle 35.6%), Our system accuracy 37.1% (oracle 76.6%).",
    "validation": "20% of tables and their questions set aside as test set. Development used three random 80:20 splits of the remaining training data. Evaluation ensures tables in test do not appear during training."
