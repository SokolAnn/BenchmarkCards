    "calculation": "Accuracy computed as percentage of correctly classified intents on standard test sets; some experiments report avg, max, and min across hyperparameter runs. Encoding speed reported as average sentences encoded per second; training/evaluation time reported in seconds.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy indicates better intent classification. Authors report absolute improvements over baselines (e.g., USE+CONVE RT improves over BERT-TUNED by +1.77 percentage points on BANKING 77 with 10 examples per intent). Faster encoding speed and lower training/evaluation time indicate greater resource efficiency.",
    "baseline_results": "Example results (Accuracy %): BANKING 77 (10-shot): BERT-TUNED 83.42, USE 84.23, CONVE RT 83.32, USE+CONVE RT 85.19 (from Table 3).",
    "validation": "Used standard test sets for each dataset. Few-shot training subsets were sampled from full data and these training subsets are released for reproducibility."
