    "name": "MARPLE (Multimodal Agent Reasoning for Long-Horizon Evaluation)",
    "abbreviation": "MARPLE",
    "overview": "MARPLE is a benchmark for evaluating long-horizon inference capabilities using multi-modal evidence. It features agents interacting with simulated households, supporting visual, language, and auditory stimuli to infer causal relationships in household scenarios, primarily focused on 'whodunit' style questions.",
