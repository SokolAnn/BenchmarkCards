  "data": {
    "source": "Data collected from 119 children in various Swiss contexts, comprising Swiss German and Swiss Standard German speech samples.",

      "Word Error Rate (WER)",
      "Character Error Rate (CER)",

    "calculation": "ASR performance is measured via WER, CER on the transcription accuracy and F1 Score for POS tagging.",
    "interpretation": "Lower WER and CER indicate better transcription accuracy; higher F1 scores indicate better tagging performance.",
    "baseline_results": "Initial ASR models showed higher error rates, but fine-tuning improved transcription performance significantly.",
    "validation": "Results are validated through comparisons of manual vs. ASR transcriptions, showing improvements in tagging accuracy post-normalization."
