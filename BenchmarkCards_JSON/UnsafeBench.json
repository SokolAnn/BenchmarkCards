    "calculation": "F1 Score is used to evaluate the effectiveness of image safety classifiers, measuring precision and recall across 11 unsafe categories.",
    "interpretation": "An F1 Score closer to 1 indicates better classifier performance, while lower scores suggest poorer effectiveness.",
    "baseline_results": "Baseline F1 Scores vary among classifiers; GPT-4V achieves high scores in multiple categories.",
    "validation": "The UnsafeBench dataset has been validated through human annotation and computing agreement statistics."
