    "source": "The TriviaHG dataset is generated based on factoid questions selected from the TriviaQA dataset, with hints produced by large language models leveraging online documents.",
    "size": "160,230 hints and 16,645 questions",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "Hints are generated automatically using a framework that employs LLMs for hint generation."

    "calculation": "HICOS is calculated based on the hint's ability to eliminate incorrect candidate answers, while HIFAS is determined using Wikipedia page views associated with the entities in the hints.",
    "interpretation": "Higher HICOS values indicate better hint quality in resolving questions, while higher HIFAS reflects greater familiarity with the information.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "The effectiveness of hints was validated through human evaluation and automatic metrics."
