The tweets were annotated by native speakers and used in the AfriSenti-SemEval shared task.",

    "goal": "To enable sentiment analysis research in African languages by creating and releasing the largest Twitter dataset for sentiment analysis in under-represented African languages (110,000+ tweets in 14 languages), and to support the AfriSenti-SemEval shared task.",

      "Polarity Classification (positive/negative/neutral)"

    "limitations": "Offensive tweets were deleted and some conflicting tweets were removed or re-annotated; the data can suffer from label bias and annotator disagreement; data collection relied on keywords and geographic locations leading to imbalanced datasets; limited to 14 languages in this release.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Collected from Twitter using the Twitter Academic API; data collection combined location-based and vocabulary-based heuristics (stopwords, sentiment lexicons, language-specific word lists); includes ten newly annotated datasets and four curated existing datasets (e.g., Yimam et al., Muhammad et al.).",
    "size": "110,000+ tweets (total across 14 languages)",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Tweets annotated by native speakers using the Simple Sentiment Questionnaire annotation guide (Mohammad, 2016); majority voting used to determine final labels (three annotators per tweet except Ethiopian languages annotated by two annotators and curated by a third); cases where all annotators disagreed were discarded. Individual annotator labels are released."

    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy and F1 Score indicate better model performance; inter-annotator agreement reported via free-marginal multi-rater kappa (values reported per language). No absolute performance thresholds are provided; authors compare models (e.g., AfroXLMR-large achieves the best overall F1 in reported experiments).",

Monolingual baseline results and per-language scores are reported in Table 7.",
    "validation": "Train/dev/test splits provided per language (see Table 6); languages with limited training data (Oromo, Tigrinya) are evaluated in zero-shot transfer; inter-annotator agreement reported and individual annotator labels released to support validation."
