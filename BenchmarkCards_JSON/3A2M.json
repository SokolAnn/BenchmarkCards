    "name": "Assorted, Archetypal and Annotated Two Million (3A2M) Cooking Recipes Dataset based on Active Learning",
    "abbreviation": "3A2M",
    "overview": "We present a novel dataset of two million culinary recipes labeled in respective categories leveraging the knowledge of food experts and an active learning technique. The dataset was constructed by collecting recipes from the RecipeNLG dataset, manually labeling 300,000 recipes by three human experts into nine categories, and categorizing the remaining 1,900,000 recipes using an active learning method combining Query-by-Committee and Human-In-The-Loop approaches. Each recipe is categorized and has an associated confidence score.",

    "goal": "Construct an annotated dataset of two million culinary recipes categorized into nine genres using domain experts and active learning so the research community can perform tasks such as recipe genre classification, recipe generation, new recipe creation, and NLP tasks like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic role labeling.",

Annotation is subject to expert subjectivity. The authors did not incorporate large pre-trained models like BERT into the active learning procedure due to resource constraints.",

    "calculation": "Fleiss Kappa computed over 300,000 expert-annotated samples. IRR computed as percent agreement among three annotators on 300,000 samples. Trustworthiness score computed from 470 labeled samples including 30 control samples selected by domain experts. Confidence scores aggregated based on annotator trustworthiness and majority/most-confident responses. In active learning, batches of 50,000 samples were predicted per iteration; labels accepted when more than three classifiers agreed (Query-by-Committee), otherwise instances were resolved via Human-in-the-Loop. ROC and Precision-Recall curves used to determine classifier cutoff values. Anderson-Darling test applied on sample distributions to obtain p-values.",
    "interpretation": "Authors use standard interpretation for Fleiss Kappa (0.20 = poor, 0.20 = fair, 0.41 = moderate, 0.61 = good, 0.81 = very good). The dataset's Fleiss Kappa (~0.4965 on 300K; ~0.56026 overall) is interpreted as moderate agreement. IRR of ~50.3977% is described as mild. Lower p-values in AD test indicate evidence against the null hypothesis.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Validation included iterative active learning with retraining after each labeling iteration, Query-by-Committee acceptance when >3 classifiers agreed, and Human-in-the-Loop resolution for disagreements. Statistical validation included Inter-Rater Reliability, Fleiss Kappa on expert annotations, Trustworthiness scores for annotators, Confidence scores for annotations, ROC/Precision-Recall analysis for classifier performance, and Anderson-Darling tests for distribution analysis."
