    "overview": "CounselingBench is a novel NCMHCE-based benchmark evaluating 22 general-purpose and medical-finetuned LLMs across five key competencies in mental health counseling. It systematically assesses how well LLMs can process and apply domain-specific knowledge from case studies to address questions evaluating these key competencies.",
