Host Matching Accuracy (HMA) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) computed by ranking the likelihood of generating a gold host response conditioned on the gold host and nine randomly sampled hosts; HMA is the proportion where the gold host is highest ranked. Role change detection evaluated as binary classification using BERT with F1 score reported.",
    "interpretation": "Lower perplexity and higher BLEU indicate better language modeling/generation fidelity. Higher Noun-phrase Overlap and topical overlap indicate greater topical relatedness. Higher Host Matching Accuracy and higher Mean Reciprocal Rank indicate stronger conditioning on host profiles. Higher F1 indicates better role change detection performance. The paper reports that speaker-conditioned models have lower perplexity and higher BLEU than speaker-agnostic baselines and that inclusion of speaker labels improves role change detection F1.",

Fine-tuned on I/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc (FT-I/n...): 17.77 (I/n...), 32.85 (DailyDialog), 51.40 (CALLHOME). Generated host responses (test set): FT DialoGPT BPE PPL 20.4; FT GPT2 BPE PPL 17.4; Speaker DialoGPT BPE PPL 15.3; Speaker GPT2 BPE PPL 17.3.
