    "overview": "CNNSum is a multi-scale long-context summarization benchmark based on Chinese novels, featuring human-driven annotations across four subsets totaling 695 samples, with lengths ranging from 16k to 128k tokens. It is designed to facilitate the evaluation of long-context summarization abilities of large language models (LLMs).",
