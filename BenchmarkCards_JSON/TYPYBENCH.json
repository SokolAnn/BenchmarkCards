    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "TYPYBENCH is a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMsâ€™ type inference across entire Python repositories. It introduces two novel metrics: TYPESIM, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and ground truth types, and TYPECHECK, which assesses type consistency across codebases.",

    "calculation": "TYPESIM measures functional similarity between predicted and human-annotated types using structural relationships. TYPECHECK uses mypy to assess type consistency across codebases.",
