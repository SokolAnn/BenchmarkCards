    "overview": "We introduce LectureBank, a dataset containing 1,352 English lecture files collected from university courses which are each classified according to an existing taxonomy as well as 208 manually-labeled prerequisite relation topics, which is publicly available. The dataset will be useful for educational purposes such as lecture preparation and organization as well as applications such as reading list generation.",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To answer the question of \"what should one learn first,\" by applying an embedding-based method to learn prerequisite relations for course concepts in the domain of NLP and to provide a lecture-slide corpus (LectureBank) annotated for taxonomy labels and prerequisite relations.",
    "audience": [
      "Students (educational users)",

      "NLP Engineers",

      "Link Prediction",

    ],
    "limitations": "For copyright reasons, we are releasing only the links to the individual lectures. The annotations may be subjective (e.g., how to treat \"long dependencies\"); annotators were directed to refer to standard university curricula for unclear pairs. The dataset has a topical bias toward deep learning and recent work, reflecting available resources.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Manually collected online lecture files (PDF/PPT) from 60 university-level courses covering five domains (NLP, ML, AI, Deep Learning, Information Retrieval). TutorialBank (Fabbri et al. 2018) was used as complementary training data and the list of 208 concepts for prerequisite annotation was taken from Fabbri et al. (2018).",
    "size": "1,352 lecture files (51,939 slides) from 60 courses; 3,443,076 tokens; vocabulary of 1,221 terms; 208 concept vertices with 921 labeled prerequisite edges.",
    "format": "Original lecture files (PDF or PPT); text extracted using PDFMiner and python-pptx. Annotations provided as labeled prerequisite relation pairs (binary) and taxonomy labels for lecture files.",
    "annotation": "Lecture files manually classified into the TutorialBank 305-topic taxonomy. Prerequisite relations: binary (yes/no) annotations by two PhD student annotators on 208 concepts; Cohen's kappa of 0.7; intersection of annotators' labels used to produce a directed concept graph with 921 edges."

    "metrics": [
      "Precision",
      "Recall",
      "F1 Score"
    ],
    "calculation": "5-fold cross-validation where the test set contains 10% of the positive prerequisite labels; an equal number of negative samples were added to the test set. The rest of the samples were used as training data. During each run, oversampling was applied on the training set. Reported scores are averages over 5 runs.",
    "interpretation": "High recall is preferred for downstream tasks such as a search engine to ensure potential prerequisites are not missed; basic classifiers (e.g., SVM) tended to have higher precision and F1, while GAE/VGAE showed high recall and lower precision. Oversampling substantially improves classifier performance in this imbalanced setting.",
