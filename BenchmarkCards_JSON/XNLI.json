    "overview": "In this work, we focus on improving the original XNLI dataset by re-translating the MNLI dataset in all of the 14 different languages present in XNLI, including the test and dev sets of XNLI using Google Translate. We also perform experiments by training models in all 15 languages and analyzing their performance on the task of natural language inference.",

    "interpretation": "The XNLI 2.0 test set yields approximately a 2.5%â€“3% higher average accuracy across the 15 languages compared to the original XNLI test set. Models trained on certain non-English high-resource languages (e.g., German) achieve higher average accuracy (German 78.15% vs English 76.63% on XNLI 2.0) indicating better cross-lingual transfer for some languages.",
    "baseline_results": "Conneau 2020 XLM-R Base reported average accuracy 76.21 (table entries). The paper reports an English-trained model average accuracy of 73.11 on the original XNLI test set and 76.63 on the XNLI 2.0 test set. The German-trained model average accuracy on XNLI 2.0 is reported as 78.15.",
    "validation": "Training/validation split used during fine-tuning: 80% of dataset for training and 20% for validation; models were fine-tuned for three epochs using the Adam optimizer and XLM-R tokenizer."
