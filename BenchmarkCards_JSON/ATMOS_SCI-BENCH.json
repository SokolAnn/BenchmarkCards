    "overview": "ATMOS SCI-BENCH is a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. It features a dual-format design comprising both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs).",
