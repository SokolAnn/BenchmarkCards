    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "VELOCITI is a benchmark to study Video-LLMs by disentangling and assessing the comprehension of agents, actions, and their associations across multiple events in videos. It adopts a video-language entailment setup with strict scoring metrics.",
    "data_type": "video-language entailment pairs",

    "goal": "To evaluate the compositional reasoning capabilities of video-language models through structured tests covering various aspects of agent and action understanding.",
    "audience": [

    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Video-Language Compositional Reasoning"

    "limitations": "The benchmark is not intended for evaluating all abilities of Video-LLMs but focuses on compositionality.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Videos are sourced from the VidSitu dataset, which includes annotations for multiple events.",
    "size": "3,101 video-language pairs",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Annotations include semantic role labeling and captions generated via an open LLM."

    "methods": [
      "Strict VLE",
      "Human evaluation"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Strict VLE requires models to proactively identify positive and negative captions correctly, offering a binary 'Yes' or 'No' response.",
    "interpretation": "Models are expected to predict 'Yes' for aligned captions and 'No' for misaligned ones. A correct prediction is a sample where the positive caption scores higher than the threshold while the negative caption scores below the threshold.",
    "baseline_results": "The best performing model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, achieves 49.3% accuracy compared to human performance at 93.0%.",
    "validation": "Quality control of test samples is performed through human verification."
