    "name": "MEMERAG (Multilingual End-to-End Meta-Evaluation Benchmark for Retrieval Augmented Generation)",
    "abbreviation": "MEMERAG",
    "overview": "This paper develops a multilingual end-to-end meta-evaluation benchmark for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that supports the development of automatic evaluators correlating well with human judgment. The benchmark is built on native-language questions and generates responses using diverse large language models, assessed for faithfulness and relevance by expert annotators.",
