    "abbreviation": "Bike-Bench",
    "overview": "Bike-Bench is an engineering design benchmark for evaluating generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and constraints in bicycle design. It quantifies performance characteristics such as aerodynamics, ergonomics, structural mechanics, and human usability, and supports a variety of design generation tasks.",
