    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "FAIRGAMER is the first bias evaluation benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, designed to evaluate social/cultural biases exhibited by LLMs and their impact on game balance through six specific tasks and a novel evaluation metric, Decision Log Standard Deviation (Dlstd).",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To evaluate and quantify the social/cultural biases of LLMs and their direct effects on game balance within video game contexts.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",
      "Game Developers"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Social Bias Detection",
      "Game Balance Evaluation"
    ],
    "limitations": "FAIRGAMER Benchmark provides valuable insights into LLM biases but has limitations including limited data coverage focusing on a small number of representative games.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Data collected from 58 Steam games encompassing both real-world and fully fictional game content.",
    "size": "89,980 test cases",
    "format": "JSON",
    "annotation": "Data structured around six tasks to evaluate biases in LLMs interactions in games."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Automated metrics"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Decision Log Standard Deviation (Dlstd)"
    ],
    "calculation": "The Dlstd metric is calculated based on the variance of decision distributions in LLM outputs to quantify bias.",
    "interpretation": "A higher Dlstd indicates greater bias among different entities, resulting in poorer game balance or unreasonable difficulty levels.",
    "baseline_results": "Experiments evaluated eight state-of-the-art models, revealing various degrees of bias across tasks.",
    "validation": "Extensive testing across multiple models and scenarios to ensure reliable measurement of LLM biases."
