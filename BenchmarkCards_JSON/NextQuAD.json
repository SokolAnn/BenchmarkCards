  "data": {
    "source": "Data was gathered through translation of SQuAD 2.0, question-answer pairs from a game application called 'Quiz of Kings', and manual data collection from well-known Persian websites.",
    "size": "7,515 contexts and 23,918 pairs of question and answer",

    "metrics": [
      "Exact Match (EM)",

    ],
    "calculation": "EM is calculated based on the exact match of responses with the ground truth answers; F1 Score is computed similarly considering both precision and recall.",
    "interpretation": "A higher Exact Match and F1 Score indicate better performance of the QA system. Values close to 1.0 signify high accuracy in answering.",
    "baseline_results": "The model achieved 0.95 Exact Match and 0.97 F1 Score on the evaluation dataset.",
    "validation": "K-fold cross-validation with five folds was employed."
