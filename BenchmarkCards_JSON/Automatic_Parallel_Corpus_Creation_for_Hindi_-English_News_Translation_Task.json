    "overview": "We have developed an automatic parallel corpus generation system prototype, which creates Hindi-English parallel corpus for news translation task. Further to verify the quality of generated parallel corpus we have experimented by taking various performance metrics (Gestalt pattern matching, Hamming distance, Damerau-Levenshtein distance).",

    "limitations": "Current generated corpus size is limited for higher thresholds (e.g., 202 sentence-pairs at 80% threshold in the reported experiment). Authors state they will try to increase the quantity of parallel corpus, mainly for the 80% threshold.",

    "source": "Crawled Hindi news from Navbharat Times; crawled English news from web pages including Times of India, The Hindu, Quora and other news sources. Translated Hindi content to English using Google Translator API to create a baseline for alignment.",
    "size": "For December 2017 experiment: 22,625 Hindi news articles crawled; 226,250 English news articles crawled. Final parallel corpus sentence-pairs: 12,798 sentence-pairs (50% threshold); 3,443 sentence-pairs (60% threshold); 987 sentence-pairs (70% threshold); 202 sentence-pairs (80% threshold).",

    "metrics": [
      "Gestalt Pattern Matching",

      "Damerau-Levenshtein Distance",
      "Simple ratio of fuzzy string matching (based on Levenshtein distance) and a word-level 'value words' metric"
    ],
    "calculation": "Hamming distance: counts differing characters between equal-length strings (padding applied when lengths differ). Damerau-Levenshtein distance: minimal number of edit operations including insertions, deletions, substitutions and transpositions as defined by the recursive formulation in the paper. Gestalt pattern matching: finds the longest adjacent identical subsequence (anchor) and recurses on subsequences. Simple ratio: weighted comparison using Levenshtein distance and word-level comparisons ('value words').",
    "interpretation": "Higher fuzzy-matching similarity threshold yields higher accuracy of the generated parallel corpus. Among the evaluated metrics, Hamming distance produced higher accuracy values than the others across reported thresholds.",
    "baseline_results": "Accuracy of parallel corpora for different thresholds (Table VII):\n50% — Gestalt Pattern Matching: 49.79; Hamming Distance: 71.73; Damerau-Levenshtein Distance: 33.09\n60% — Gestalt Pattern Matching: 50.04; Hamming Distance: 73.4; Damerau-Levenshtein Distance: 43.14\n70% — Gestalt Pattern Matching: 66.6; Hamming Distance: 77.98; Damerau-Levenshtein Distance: 56.3\n80% — Gestalt Pattern Matching: 80.04; Hamming Distance: 85.19; Damerau-Levenshtein Distance: 69.36",
    "validation": "Validated by computing accuracies of the generated parallel corpus at multiple similarity thresholds (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%) using Gestalt Pattern Matching, Hamming Distance, and Damerau-Levenshtein Distance on data crawled for December 2017 (22,625 Hindi articles; 226,250 English articles). Sample sentence-pairs for each threshold are provided in Tables II–V."
