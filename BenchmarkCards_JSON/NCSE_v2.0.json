    "abbreviation": "NCSE v2.0",
    "overview": "The NCSE v2.0 dataset features improved article identification, high-quality OCR, and text classified into four types and seventeen topics, created from a collection of 19th-century English newspapers and periodicals using an image-to-text model.",

    "calculation": "Character Error Rate (CER) is calculated as the sum of character substitutions, deletions, and insertions divided by the total number of characters.",
    "interpretation": "A lower CER indicates better OCR accuracy. An F1 Score measures the balance between precision and recall in classification tasks.",
    "baseline_results": "Pixtral achieved a median CER of 0.01, outperforming all other OCR methods.",
    "validation": "Evaluation was performed on the NCSE test set and BLN600 for quality assurance."
