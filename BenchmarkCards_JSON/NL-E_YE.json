    "abbreviation": "NL-E YE",
    "overview": "NL-E YE is a benchmark designed to assess VLMsâ€™ visual abductive reasoning skills by adapting the abductive Natural Language Inference task to the visual domain. It evaluates the plausibility of hypothesis images based on a premise image and requires models to explain their decisions.",
