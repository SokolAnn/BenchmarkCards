    "goal": "The primary objective of the benchmark is to provide a method for dataset-level membership inference without requiring access to ground-truth member or non-member data in identical distribution.",

    "calculation": "Metrics were calculated based on changes in average negative log-likelihood (A-NLL) before and after paraphrasing, and hypothesis testing was used to infer membership.",
    "interpretation": "An increase in A-NLL indicates that the data is more likely to be part of the training set.",
    "baseline_results": "SMI outperformed traditional membership inference methods on various models and datasets, achieving an average F1 score of 0.984 across assessed scenarios.",
    "validation": "The benchmark was validated through extensive experiments across various datasets and models."
