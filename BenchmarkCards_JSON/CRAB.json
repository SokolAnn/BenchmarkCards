    "overview": "CRAB is a new Causal Reasoning Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate causal understanding of events in real-world narratives. It includes fine-grained, contextual causality annotations for approximately 2,700 pairs of real-world events that describe various newsworthy event timelines, allowing evaluation of language models' performance on causal reasoning tasks.",
