    "abbreviation": "SIFo",
    "overview": "The SIFo benchmark evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow a sequence of instructions effectively by using four tasks: text modification, question answering, mathematics, and security rules. Each task assesses different aspects of instruction following in a coherent manner.",
