    "calculation": "Leakage Ratio is calculated as the number of leaked samples over the total number of samples in the benchmark.",
    "interpretation": "Higher leakage ratios indicate greater risks to evaluation validity due to potential prior exposure of LLMs to benchmark data.",

    "validation": "Manual verification of flagged duplicate pairs identified by the automated tool."
