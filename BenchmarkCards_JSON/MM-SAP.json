    "abbreviation": "MM-SAP",
    "overview": "The MM-SAP benchmark is designed to evaluate the self-awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in their capacity to recognize what they can and cannot perceive from images. It integrates a knowledge quadrant framework for a more comprehensive assessment of self-awareness in visual perception.",

    "calculation": "Self-awareness is evaluated using scores based on answered knowns and properly refused unknowns.",
    "interpretation": "A higher self-awareness score indicates better capability of the MLLM to recognize its knowledge limits.",
