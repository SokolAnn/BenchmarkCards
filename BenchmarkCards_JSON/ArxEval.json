    "overview": "ArxEval is an evaluation pipeline designed for assessing the frequency with which language models hallucinate when generating responses in scientific literature. It includes two main tasks: Jumbled Titles and Mixed Titles, aimed at evaluating the reliability of language models in handling academic content accurately.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the cosine similarity between the generated response and the original abstract using various scoring models.",
    "interpretation": "Higher similarity scores indicate better adherence to factual accuracy and ability to generate coherent responses under prompt constraints.",
    "baseline_results": "Mistral v0.3 achieved the highest similarity scores, while Orca-2 was the lowest performing model.",
    "validation": "The evaluation was conducted using a comparative analysis of multiple language models against defined tasks."
