    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the pass rate of test cases written for each coding task in the dataset.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Pass@1 and Pass@3 indicates better model performance in solving coding tasks.",
    "baseline_results": "Models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o achieved notable scores on SWE-Dev but struggled with complex tasks.",
    "validation": "Validation is performed via executable unit tests that check the implemented features."
