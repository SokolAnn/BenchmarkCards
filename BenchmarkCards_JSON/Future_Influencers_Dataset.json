    "limitations": "Analysis confined to a specific subset of Twitter users (influencers), which may restrict generalizability; not all tweets attributed to future influencers necessarily reflect their own future anticipations (some may be retweets or quotations); study limited to tweets published by future influencers and did not include user comments or associated sentiment analysis.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Tweets were obtained using the scraping library snsscrape; Tweets were gathered between 1 January 2021 and 31 March 2023; the dataset comprises tweets posted by 'future influencers' selected by human experts (final list included about 250 futurists).",

    "calculation": "Coherence calculated using the C_V measure developed by Röder et al.; hyperparameters optimized by maximizing coherence and using expert judgment; LDA and BERTopic trained in batches for scalability.",
    "interpretation": "Higher C_V coherence indicates better topic coherence; LDA achieved a coherence score reported as \"more than 50%\" (described as decent for its class); BERTopic achieved coherence of 65% (described as good); consistent topic contributions over time suggest themes remain relevant.",
    "baseline_results": "LDA: identified 15 topics with a coherence score of more than 50%. BERTopic: produced ~100 hierarchically organized clusters (coherence ~65%), which can be merged to ~20 well-separated topics (with a loss in coherence).",
    "validation": "Validation performed via the C_V coherence score (Röder et al.) and expert judgment; n=15 chosen as optimal for LDA based on C_V; BERTopic topics evaluated for coherence and optionally merged (trade-off between number of topics and coherence)."
