    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)"
    ],
    "calculation": "AUC is calculated based on the ratio of member neuron activation to non-member neuron activation for given data inputs.",
    "interpretation": "Higher AUC indicates better performance in detecting whether specific data was part of the training corpus.",
    "baseline_results": "NA-PDD significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving an AUC of 99.7% on CCNewsPDD.",
    "validation": "Evaluated across three benchmark datasets with a focus on eliminating time drift confounding effects."
