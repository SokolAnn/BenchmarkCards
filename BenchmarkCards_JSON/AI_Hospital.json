    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated by comparing the LLM-based doctor reports against expert evaluations using predefined scales and accuracy measures.",
    "interpretation": "Higher scores indicate better performance in diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendations, while lower scores reflect deficiencies in the LLM's clinical reasoning capabilities.",
