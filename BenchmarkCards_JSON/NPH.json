    "name": "Neural Path Hunter",
    "abbreviation": "NPH",
    "overview": "Neural Path Hunter (NPH) introduces a refinement strategy for dialogue systems aiming to reduce hallucination in generated responses by utilizing external Knowledge Graphs (KG). It operates by identifying hallucinations and correcting them through a generate-then-refine approach, significantly improving factual accuracy in dialogueresponses.",
