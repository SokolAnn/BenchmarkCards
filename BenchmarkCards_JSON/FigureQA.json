    "overview": "We introduce FigureQA, a visual reasoning corpus of over one million question-answer pairs grounded in over 100,000 images. The images are synthetic, scientific-style figures from five classes (line, dot-line, vertical and horizontal bar, and pie charts). Questions (15 templates) examine relationships between plot elements (e.g., maximum, minimum, area-under-the-curve, smoothness, intersection) and are posed as binary yes/no answers. The corpus includes supplementary data: the numerical data used to generate each figure and bounding-box annotations for all plot elements.",

    "goal": "To provide a large-scale synthetically generated corpus to study visual reasoning and comprehension in machines on scientific-style figures, and to facilitate development of models that intuitively recognize patterns from visual representations of data.",

    "size": "Training: 100,000 images with 1.3 million questions; Validation: 20,000 images with over 250,000 questions; Test: 20,000 images with over 250,000 questions; Corpus total: over 1 million question-answer pairs grounded in over 100,000 images.",

    "annotation": "Questions generated from 15 predefined templates applied to source numerical data; one yes and one no question generated per applicable template then filtered to balance yes/no answers. Bounding boxes for all plot elements extracted via a modified Bokeh backend. Numerical source data retained and released alongside images."

  "methodology": {
    "methods": [
      "Model-based evaluation (training neural baseline models: text-only LSTM, CNN+LSTM, CNN+LSTM on VGG-16 features, Relation Network)",
      "Automated evaluation using Accuracy on validation and test sets",
      "Human evaluation (editorial staff baseline on a subset of test set)"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "Accuracy"
    ],
    "calculation": "Accuracy is computed as the percentage of correctly answered binary (yes/no) questions on validation and test sets. During training, validation accuracy is measured on one randomly selected validation batch per training step and an exponential moving average with decay 0.9 is kept; early stopping is performed based on this moving average starting from the 100th update.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Accuracy indicates better model performance on the question-answering task. The paper uses a human baseline (91.21% on a subset of the test set) as reference; model accuracies (e.g., Relation Network at ~72% test accuracy) indicate a gap to human performance and room for improvement.",
    "baseline_results": "Validation/Test accuracies (alternated color scheme): Text-only: 50.01% / 50.01%; CNN+LSTM: 56.16% / 56.00%; CNN+LSTM on VGG-16 features: 52.31% / 52.47%; Relation Network (RN): 72.54% / 72.40%. On a human-evaluated subset (test, alternated color scheme): CNN+LSTM 56.04%, RN 72.18%, Human 91.21%. RN achieves 72.40% and 76.52% on test sets depending on color-scheme/training variant as reported.",
    "validation": "Datasets constructed with an 'alternated color scheme' (colors in validation/test are from a disjoint subset relative to training) to test generalization; validation accuracy measured on a randomly selected validation batch per training step and tracked via exponential moving average (decay 0.9) for early stopping. The dataset is balanced per question type for yes/no answers to avoid answer-frequency bias."
