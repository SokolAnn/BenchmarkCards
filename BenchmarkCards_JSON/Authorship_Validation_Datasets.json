    ],
    "calculation": "Performance metrics calculated based on true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives across different datasets.",
    "interpretation": "Accuracy measures the total number of correct predictions while the F1 Score represents the balance between precision and recall.",
    "baseline_results": "Naive Bayes achieved a maximum accuracy of 94.59% and an F1 score of 95.13%. Char-CNN achieved a maximum accuracy of 98.92% and an F1 score of 98.59%.",
    "validation": "Classifiers were validated using a split of 80:20 for training and testing across the constructed datasets."
