    "goal": "To assess search agents' epistemic behaviors reflecting sound evidence practices, including reasoning grounded in evidence, adaptive search, and calibrated decision-making under uncertainty.",

    "calculation": "Metrics are calculated based on the annotated features of agent response traces and their epistemic behaviors.",
    "interpretation": "Higher RQI indicates better reasoning quality, while lower ERF represents effective recovery from insufficient evidence, and lower CE shows better calibration.",

    "validation": "Human annotators achieved high inter-annotator reliability (Cohen's Kappa Îº > 0.8) and strong alignment with LLM judges."
