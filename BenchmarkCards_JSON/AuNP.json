    "abbreviation": "AuNP",
    "overview": "We have constructed and made publicly available a dataset of codiﬁed gold nanoparticle synthesis protocols and outcomes extracted directly from the nanoparticle materials science literature using natural language processing and text-mining techniques. This dataset contains 5,154 data records, each representing a single gold nanoparticle synthesis article, filtered from a database of 4,973,165 publications. Each record contains codiﬁed synthesis protocols and extracted morphological information from a total of 7,608 experimental and 12,519 characterization paragraphs.",

    "limitations": "The dataset does not contain entity linking (e.g., particle size to specific nanoparticle morphology or morphological entity to synthesis procedure). The synthesis action extraction cannot distinguish constituent steps of seed-mediated syntheses (seed preparation, growth solution, combination). Materials entity recognition does not detect entities that do not contain specific material formulae or chemical names (e.g., 'AuNP seed solution' or 'growth solution' may not be detected). There is currently no way to distinguish extracted morphologies as either the desired target morphology or as incidental mentions. The authors accepted higher precision than recall for some extraction methods to avoid introducing incorrect information.",

    "annotation": "Combination of automated extraction and manual annotation for training data: manual annotation by experts for training sets (e.g., 1,281 synthesis paragraphs annotated for Materials Entity Recognition, 739 paragraphs annotated for synthesis paragraph classification, 299 paragraphs for characterization paragraph classification, 119 characterization paragraphs annotated for MorphER). Extraction for the full dataset performed with NLP/text-mining models and rule-based methods; manual validation performed on selected samples."

Rule-based extraction methods were evaluated via manual validation on sampled paragraphs. Reported metrics for pipeline components are shown in Table 4 of the paper.",
    "interpretation": "The authors prioritized higher precision over recall for certain extraction and rule-based methods to avoid introducing incorrect information into the dataset. High precision indicates fewer false positives at the cost of potentially lower completeness (recall).",

    "validation": "Validation procedures included: manual validation on sampled paragraphs and extractions (e.g., 50 seed-mediated tag checks with 49/50 valid), comparison to an external 35k article nanomaterial dataset (Hiszpanski et al.) to evaluate article filtering coverage, and manual validation of rule-based extraction methods on 100 solution-based synthesis paragraphs as reported in related work. Model performance metrics were reported on held-out test sets."
