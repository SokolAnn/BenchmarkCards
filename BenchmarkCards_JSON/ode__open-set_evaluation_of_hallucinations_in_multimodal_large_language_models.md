# ODE: Open-Set Evaluation of Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ODE: Open-Set Evaluation of Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models

**Overview**: ODE is an open-set, dynamic protocol designed to evaluate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) at both the existence and attribute levels. It employs a graph-based structure to represent real-world object concepts, their attributes, and distributional associations, generating varied samples for structured queries that evaluate hallucinations.
