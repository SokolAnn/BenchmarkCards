    "name": "Durghotona GPT: A Web Scraping and Large Language Model Based Framework to Generate Road Accident Dataset Automatically in Bangladesh",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "This paper presents a novel framework named ‘Durghotona GPT’ that integrates web scraping and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of comprehensive accident datasets from prominent national dailies in Bangladesh. The framework efficiently extracts relevant information, categorizes reports and compiles detailed datasets.",
