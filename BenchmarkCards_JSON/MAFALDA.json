    "name": "MAFALDA (Multi-level Annotated Fallacy Dataset)",
    "abbreviation": "MAFALDA",
    "overview": "MAFALDA is a benchmark for fallacy classification that merges and unites previous fallacy datasets, providing a taxonomy that aligns, refines, and unifies existing classifications of fallacies, along with a new annotation scheme allowing for subjective annotations.",

      "Fallacy Detection",
      "Fallacy Classification"
    ],
    "limitations": "The dataset may contain sensitive content such as racism and misogyny, and it is relatively small due to the time-intensive nature of the annotation process.",
    "out_of_scope_uses": []
  },
  "data": {
    "source": "The benchmark merges multiple existing fallacy datasets, including those from Sahai et al. (2021), Martino et al. (2019), Jin et al. (2022), and Goffredo et al. (2022).",
    "size": "9,745 texts (200 annotated texts)",
    "format": "N/A",
    "annotation": "Manual annotation by authors with explanations for each annotation, including the introduction of a new disjunctive annotation scheme."

    "metrics": [
      "F1 Score",
      "Precision",
      "Recall"
    ],
    "calculation": "Precision and recall are calculated based on the matches between annotations and predictions.",
    "interpretation": "Higher F1 scores indicate better performance in detecting and classifying fallacies.",
    "baseline_results": "Performance results across several models with human baseline comparisons provided in the study.",
    "validation": "All annotations were discussed among authors to reach consensus or provide alternative annotations."
