    "name": "Scaling Robot Supervision to Hundreds of Hours with RoboTurk: Robotic Manipulation Dataset through Human Reasoning and Dexterity",
    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "We leverage and extend the RoboTurk platform to scale up data collection for robotic manipulation using remote teleoperation to (1) increase the total quantity of manipulation data collected through human supervision by an order of magnitude without sacrificing the quality of the data and (2) collect data on challenging manipulation tasks across several operators and observe a diverse set of emergent behaviors and solutions. We collected over 111 hours of robot manipulation data across 54 users and 3 challenging manipulation tasks in 1 week, resulting in the largest robot dataset collected via remote teleoperation.",
    "data_type": "multimodal: RGB images, depth images, robot sensor time-series (joint and end-effector readings), and teleoperator video streams",

    "source": "Collected via the extended RoboTurk platform through remote teleoperation on three Sawyer robot arms across 54 users performing the three tasks (Object Search, Tower Creation, Laundry Layout).",
    "size": "111.25 hours total; 2,144 demonstrations; 54 users; collected over 1 week.",
    "format": "ROS rosbags containing RGB images (front-facing camera) at 30Hz, RGB and Depth images (top-down Kinectv2) at 30Hz, and robot sensor readings (joint and end-effector) at approximately 100Hz.",

      "Total demonstration time (hours)",
      "Number of demonstrations"

    "calculation": "Total workload (NASA TLX) was computed as the sum of the averaged subscales. Average user exertion was estimated by the square L2 norms of phone translations. Embedding-based reward used negative L2 distance in the learned embedding space (modified TCN).",
    "interpretation": "Decreasing task completion time indicates improved user performance; higher NASA TLX scores indicate higher workload; smaller embedding distance to a terminal (successful) frame indicates closer task progress or success; average effort (L2 norm) largely invariant with experience while orientation change increases with experience.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Validated the platform and dataset via quantitative analyses (skill improvement over experience, task completion time, effort, orientation change), qualitative analyses (diversity of demonstrations), NASA TLX user studies, and comparative dataset statistics (Table I) against prior human-supervised robot datasets."
