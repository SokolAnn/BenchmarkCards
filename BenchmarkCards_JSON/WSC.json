    "abbreviation": "WSC",
    "overview": "This benchmark introduces the Word Synchronization Challenge, a novel benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It assesses LLMs’ ability to mimic human cognitive processes through word associations, simulating complex human interactions.",
