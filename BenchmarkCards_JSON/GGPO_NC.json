    "name": "GGPO NC (German Guideline Program in Oncology NLP Corpus)",
    "abbreviation": "GGPO NC",
    "overview": "We present GGPO NC (German Guideline Program in Oncology NLP Corpus), a freely distributable German language corpus based on clinical practice guidelines for oncology. This corpus is one of the largest ever built from German medical documents, does not contain patient-related information and can therefore be used without data protection restrictions, and provides a variety of metadata such as literature references and evidence levels.",
    "data_type": "text (clinical practice guideline documents; recommendation and background text segments; XML and plain text formats)",

  "purpose_and_intended_users": {
    "goal": "To address (1) the lack of available German medical text resources for NLP research, and (2) the need for machine-readable clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), by constructing a corpus based on a set of German CPGs for oncology.",
    "audience": [
      "Natural Language Processing researchers",
      "Medical and clinical researchers",

      "Information Extraction",
      "Semantic Search",
      "Evidence-based medicine summarization",
      "Temporal tracking of guideline changes"
    ],
    "limitations": "Gene extraction suffers from a large number of false positives due to lexical overlap with common German words and acronyms; the German UMLS vocabulary is limited (~234k entries) which reduces recall; inconsistent handling of German umlauts and compound words in UMLS and tokenization leads to false negatives and inconsistent entity matches; certain TNM expressions can cause context-dependent semantic ambiguities.",

  },
  "data": {
    "source": "Semi-structured JSON versions of the guidelines acquired from the REST API of the Content Management System (CMS) that serves the backend for the GGPO mobile app; data were transformed from JSON to an XML format preserving document structure, recommendation metadata and literature references.",
    "size": "Full corpus: 8,414 text segments; 4,348 recommendations; 59,672 sentences; 1,340,201 tokens; 76,252 types; 37,928 literature references. Annotated subset: 4,153 text segments; 2,069 recommendations; 29,528 sentences; 664,029 tokens; 50,732 types; 18,585 references.",
    "format": "A single XML file including document structure and metadata; a file for the complete literature index; individual plain text versions of text segments, sentences, and tokens; automatically created entity annotations and a subset of manually corrected annotations in standoff format.",
    "annotation": "Automated annotations using JCORE (UIMA-based) pipelines, FRAMED models, JUFIT filtering for UMLS terms, and a rule-based TNM extractor implemented with spaCy; a subset was manually reviewed by medical-student annotators using the BRAT annotation tool (manually reviewed subset covers 13 guidelines / ~half of corpus)."

    "methods": [
      "Automated annotation pipelines (JCORE, FRAMED, JUFIT, spaCy rule-based TNM extraction)",

    "calculation": "Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated using the pair-wise average F-score of instances and tokens (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005). Micro-averaged precision and recall were computed against the manually reviewed annotations as gold standard.",
    "interpretation": "The IAA achieved an average F-score of 0.742 on instances and 0.758 on tokens for the evaluated subset. Precision and recall vary by entity class (see reported per-class results). Gene annotations exhibited a very large number of false positives and were excluded from IAA analysis.",
    "baseline_results": "Overall (without Genes): IAA instances average F-score = 0.742 (std = 0.094); IAA token average F-score = 0.758 (std = 0.094); micro-averaged Precision = 0.945; micro-averaged Recall = 0.528.",
    "validation": "A manually reviewed subset covering 13 full guidelines (~half the corpus) was used for validation. The IAA calculation used 40 agreement documents (20 high-annotation segments per four guidelines + 20 randomly sampled segments) totaling approx. 19,000 tokens annotated by all annotators."
