Okapi introduces instruction and response-ranked data in 26 diverse languages and presents benchmark datasets (translated ARC, HellaSwag, and MMLU) to enable evaluation of generative LLMs in multiple languages.",

    "goal": "Develop an open-source RLHF-based instruction-tuned LLM framework for multiple languages, create instruction and response-ranked data in 26 languages, and provide translated benchmark datasets to evaluate generative LLMs across multiple languages.",

    "limitations": "Coverage limited to 26 languages (not exhaustive); experiments use BLOOM and LLaMA 7B base models only; instruction and evaluation data are automatically generated and translated via ChatGPT which may introduce noise and may not reflect human-provided data; evaluations do not explicitly measure hallucination, toxicity, or biases.",

    "size": "158,000 instruction examples (52,000 from Alpaca + 106,000 generated); 42,000 ranked instruction examples; translated evaluation datasets: ARC: 1,170 examples; HellaSwag: 9,162 examples; MMLU: 13,062 examples.",
