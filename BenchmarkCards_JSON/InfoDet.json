    "abbreviation": "InfoDet",
    "overview": "InfoDet is a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) in infographics. It contains 11,264 real and 90,000 synthetic infographics, with over 14 million bounding box annotations.",
