    "calculation": "The Macro F1 Score is calculated as the average of F1 scores across all classes in the test set.",
    "interpretation": "Higher Macro F1 Scores indicate better performance of the NLI models on the financial reasoning tasks.",
    "baseline_results": "The highest Macro F1 scores observed were 74.57% for pre-trained language models and 78.62% for large language models.",
    "validation": "The dataset was validated through expert annotation and pre-processing to ensure quality."
