    "abbreviation": "CALM",
    "overview": "CALM is introduced for robust measurement of social biases in language models by utilizing a diverse set of templates generated from existing datasets, covering three NLP tasks: Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis, and Natural Language Inference.",
    "data_type": "question-answering pairs",

    "goal": "To quantify language model bias in a consistent and rigorous manner, focusing on gender and race biases.",
    "audience": [
      "ML Researchers",

    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Question Answering",
      "Sentiment Analysis",
      "Natural Language Inference"
    ],
    "limitations": "The datasetâ€™s target word list is limited to seven social groups in the US and the templates are in English, which may restrict broader bias assessment.",

  "data": {
    "source": "Derived from sixteen datasets for question-answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference.",

      "Bias score"
    ],
    "calculation": "The bias score is calculated as the percentage difference from the baseline performance for each social group.",
    "interpretation": "Lower scores indicate less bias; a model with a bias score of 0% is considered unbiased.",
    "baseline_results": null,
    "validation": "Sensitivity analysis conducted to assess the reliability and robustness of the CALM dataset through various perturbations."
