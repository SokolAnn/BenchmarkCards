    "abbreviation": "N/A",
    "overview": "TTS-Uniform is a framework designed to mitigate the selection bias of reasoning strategies in large language models (LLMs) when applying test-time scaling. It aims to enhance the effectiveness of scaling by uniformly allocating the sampling budget across diverse reasoning strategies.",
