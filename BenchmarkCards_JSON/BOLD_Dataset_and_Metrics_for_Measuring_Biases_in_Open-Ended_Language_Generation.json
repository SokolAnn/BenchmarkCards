    "overview": "BOLD is a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology. It proposes new automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended text generation.",
