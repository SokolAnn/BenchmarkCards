    "name": "HEADLINES (Historical Enormous-Scale Abstractive DupLIcate NewsSummaries)",
    "abbreviation": "HEADLINES",
    "overview": "HEADLINES is a massive-scale semantic similarity dataset containing nearly 400 million high quality semantic similarity pairs drawn from 70 years (1920-1989) of off-copyright U.S. local newspapers. Positive pairs are headlines written by different papers that summarize the same underlying wire article; the dataset is intended to facilitate contrastive training and evaluation of models that capture abstractive semantic similarity, and enables study of semantic change across space and time.",

    "goal": "To provide a very large, publicly available semantic similarity dataset spanning 1920-1989 (nearly 400M positive headline pairs) to facilitate contrastive training and evaluation of semantic similarity models, study semantic change across space and time, and support downstream tasks such as clustering, retrieval, semantic search, and topic classification of historical archives.",

    ],
    "calculation": "Character error rate is the Levenshtein distance between the transcribed text and the ground truth, normalized by the length of the ground truth. For MTEB-style similarity, random samples (up to 10,000 texts per year) were embedded (all-mpnet-base-v2), pairwise nearest neighbors by cosine similarity computed and averaged to obtain SIM_jk. For clustering benchmarks, texts are embedded, k-means is run with k equal to the ground-truth number of clusters, and v-measure is computed. ARI and clustering comparisons are computed against hand-labeled reproduced-article pairs.",
    "interpretation": "Higher v-measure and ARI indicate better clustering performance. Character Error Rate lower values indicate better OCR quality. Authors report that HEADLINES yields substantially higher clustering v-measures (e.g., ST5-XXL ~78 on HEADLINES) compared to many MTEB datasets (e.g., MPNet average v-score 43.69), indicating high-quality clusters; ARI values closer to 100 indicate better reproduced-content detection.",
    "baseline_results": "Article association: Full Article Association F1=93.7, Recall=88.3, Precision=99.7 (evaluation on 214 scans / 3,803 labeled bounding boxes). Reproduced-content detection: Bi-encoder ARI=91.5; Re-ranking (bi-encoder + cross-encoder) ARI=93.7; LSH ARI=73.7; N-gram overlap ARI=75.0 (evaluated on sample with 54,996 positive pairs and 100,914,159 negative pairs). Clustering (MTEB-style): best average v-score across MTEB datasets from MPNet = 43.69; best average v-score across decades for HEADLINES from ST5-XXL â‰ˆ 78. OCR character error rates reported per decade in Table 1 (e.g., overall character error rates by decade provided).",
    "validation": "Multiple hand-labeled evaluation sets: OCR evaluated on a hand-annotated sample of 300 headlines per decade; article association evaluated on 214 scans (3,803 article bounding boxes, 2,805 headline boxes, 1,851 article-article associations); reproduced-content detection evaluated on a labeled sample (54,996 positive pairs and 100,914,159 negative pairs) drawn from front-page articles in selected days/decades. Hyperparameters and model selection used validation splits as described in supplementary materials."
