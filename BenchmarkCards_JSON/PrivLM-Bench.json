    "name": "PrivLM-Bench",
    "overview": "PrivLM-Bench is a multi-perspective privacy evaluation benchmark for language models (LMs), designed to quantify privacy leakage without ignoring inference data privacy. It defines multifaceted privacy objectives and utilizes a unified pipeline for private fine-tuning while performing privacy attacks to evaluate existing privacy-preserving language models (PPLMs).",
