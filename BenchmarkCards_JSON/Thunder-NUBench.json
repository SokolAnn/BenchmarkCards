    "overview": "Thunder-NUBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' sentence-level understanding of negation, contrasting standard negation with structurally diverse alternatives such as local negation, contradiction, and paraphrase. It consists of manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset for deep evaluation.",
