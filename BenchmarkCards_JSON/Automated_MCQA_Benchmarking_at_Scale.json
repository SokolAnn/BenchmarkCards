    "overview": "We introduce a scalable, modular framework for generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from large corpora of scientific papers. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from 22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology and evaluate small language models on these questions.",
