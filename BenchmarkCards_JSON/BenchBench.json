It addresses inconsistencies in benchmarking methodologies and provides a standardized procedure for testing the validity of new benchmarks by comparing them to established ones.",

    "calculation": "Agreement is calculated by comparing performance scores of models across different benchmarks using correlation metrics like Kendall-tau for ranks and Pearson for scores.",
    "interpretation": "High agreement indicates that a benchmark measures similar abilities as established benchmarks, while low agreement suggests a unique trait measured by the benchmark.",
