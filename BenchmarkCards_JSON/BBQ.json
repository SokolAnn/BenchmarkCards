    ],
    "calculation": "Bias scores reflect the degree to which a model systematically produces answers that align with social biases.",
    "interpretation": "Higher accuracy in disambiguated contexts compared to ambiguous contexts; models show different reliance on biases depending on context.",

    "validation": "Examples were validated via Amazon Mechanical Turk with a threshold of 4/5 annotators agreeing with gold labels for inclusion."
