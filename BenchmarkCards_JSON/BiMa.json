    "name": "BiMa (Bias Mitigation for Text-Video Retrieval)",
    "abbreviation": "BiMa",
    "overview": "BiMa is a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations within text-video retrieval (TVR) systems. It integrates scene elements into video embeddings and introduces a mechanism for disentangling text features into content and bias components, enhancing model performance and robustness against biases.",
