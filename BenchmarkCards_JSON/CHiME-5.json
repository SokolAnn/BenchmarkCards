    "overview": "The CHiME-5 Challenge considers the task of distant multi-microphone conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real home environments. Speech material was elicited using a 4-people dinner party scenario recorded by 6 Kinect microphone arrays and 4 binaural microphone pairs in 20 homes. The challenge features a single-array track and a multiple-array track and provides detailed baseline systems for array synchronization, speech enhancement, conventional ASR and end-to-end ASR.",
