    "name": "CRAFT (Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning)",
    "abbreviation": "CRAFT",
    "overview": "CRAFT is a framework for generating task-specific synthetic datasets grounded in text corpora, requiring only a small set of human-curated few-shot examples to initiate. It retrieves relevant documents and uses instruction-tuned large language models to augment them into task-specific samples for fine-tuning models across various domains.",
