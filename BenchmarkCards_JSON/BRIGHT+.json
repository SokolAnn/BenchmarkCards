    "abbreviation": "BRIGHT+",
    "overview": "We introduce BRIGHT+, a high-quality refinement of the BRIGHT benchmark tailored for retrieval-augmented reasoning. By identifying and addressing two major flaws—content redundancy and semantic discontinuity—we developed MARCUS, an LLM-powered clean-and-split pipeline that produces coherent, retrievable chunks.",
