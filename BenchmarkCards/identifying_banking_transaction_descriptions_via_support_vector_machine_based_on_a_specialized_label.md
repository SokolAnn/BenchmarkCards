# Identifying Banking Transaction Descriptions via Support Vector Machine Based on a Specialized Labelled Corpus

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Identifying Banking Transaction Descriptions via Support Vector Machine Based on a Specialized Labelled Corpus

**Overview**: This paper describes a novel system that combines Natural Language Processing techniques with Machine Learning algorithms to classify banking transaction descriptions for personal finance management.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Finance

**Languages**:
- Spanish

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop a simple and efficient short-text classification system for banking transaction descriptions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Financial Analysts

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Labelled dataset with real customer transactions from major Spanish banks.

**Size**: 30,844 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: The dataset is labelled with predefined categories for classification.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification
- Text similarity detection using Jaccard distance

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Macro-averaged metrics were computed based on the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each category.

**Interpretation**: After enabling all features, precision is prioritized followed by recall, especially for financial applications.

**Baseline Results**: Compared with three competitor approaches with differing results in precision and recall rates.

**Validation**: Cross-validation was performed with various splits of training and testing subsets.
