# ONEBench (OpeN-Ended Benchmarking)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ONEBench (OpeN-Ended Benchmarking)

**Overview**: ONEBench is a new paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. It enables custom benchmarks for specific capabilities while reusing and aggregating samples, mitigating overfitting and dataset bias for broader capability assessment.

**Data Type**: sample-level evaluations

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- GLUE
- SuperGLUE
- BigBench
- HELM
- VHELM

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/username/repository)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate models using a continuously expanding pool of test data samples drawn from multiple benchmarks and to provide a democratized, customizable evaluation framework.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
