# LONG SAFETY

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LONG SAFETY

**Overview**: LONG SAFETY is the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM safety in open-ended long-context tasks, encompassing 7 categories of safety issues and 6 user-oriented long-context tasks.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a systematic evaluation of safety vulnerabilities in long-context tasks for large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Generation
- Brainstorming
- Summarization
- Rewrite
- Role-playing

**Limitations**: While LONG SAFETY provides a comprehensive evaluation, some attack-oriented tasks, such as many-shot jailbreaking, are not included.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Documents sourced from the Internet related to various safety topics.

**Size**: 1,543 instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotation by crowd-workers to curate safety instructions relevant to each context.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Multi-agent evaluation framework

**Metrics**:
- Safety rate

**Calculation**: Safety rate is calculated as the proportion of instances for which both responses to the two concatenation formats are assessed as safe.

**Interpretation**: Higher safety rates indicate better safety performance in long-context scenarios.

**Validation**: Evaluated on 16 representative long-context LLMs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
