# MM-GCoT (Multimodal Grounded Chain-of-Thought)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MM-GCoT (Multimodal Grounded Chain-of-Thought)

**Overview**: MM-GCoT is a dataset designed to alleviate visual hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by enhancing their visual-spatial reasoning capabilities through a new learning task termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). It contains training examples for teaching models to ground their reasoning steps with visual evidence.

**Data Type**: multimodal
