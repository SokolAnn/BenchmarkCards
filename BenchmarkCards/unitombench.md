# UniToMBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: UniToMBench

**Overview**: UniToMBench is a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess Theory of Mind capabilities in large language models (LLMs) through multi-interaction task designs and evolving story scenarios.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- SimToM
- TOMBENCH

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve and assess Theory of Mind capabilities in large language models by providing a comprehensive evaluation framework.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Education Professionals

**Tasks**:
- Theory of Mind Evaluation
- Multi-Interaction Tasks
- Evolving Story Tasks

**Limitations**: The tasks designed may not fully represent the diversity and complexity of real-world social interactions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Custom dataset with 1,025 annotated scenarios, combining questions from TOMBENCH and original scenarios.

**Size**: 1,025 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Hand-written annotation

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Task completion accuracy
- Error attribution analysis
- Consistency across runs

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the percentage of correct answers across various Theory of Mind tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in understanding and predicting human mental states, while errors showcase limitations in social reasoning.

**Baseline Results**: Comparative performance results between baseline models and SimToM-enhanced models on various tasks.

**Validation**: Evaluation across diverse scenarios designed to assess depth in Theory of Mind capabilities.
