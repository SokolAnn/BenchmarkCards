## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark that reflects the real-world capabilities of LLMs in code generation tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: EvoCodeBench is currently a monolingual benchmark that primarily focuses on English and Python.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from 25 real-world open-source repositories on GitHub

**Size**: 275 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Comprehensive annotations including requirements, reference code, and dependencies

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Pass@k
- Recall@k

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on test cases to evaluate functional correctness and dependency invocation.

**Interpretation**: Higher Pass@k and Recall@k values indicate better code generation performance of LLMs.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Results are validated against real-world code generation tasks.
