## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MeDAL (Medical Abbreviation Disambiguation Dataset for Natural Language Understanding Pretraining)

**Overview**: MeDAL is a large medical text dataset curated for abbreviation disambiguation, designed for natural language understanding pre-training in the medical domain.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BruceWen120/medal)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enable effective pre-training and improve performance on downstream medical tasks during fine-tuning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Abbreviation Disambiguation
- Mortality Prediction
- Diagnosis Prediction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Created from PubMed abstracts released in 2019

**Size**: 14,393,619 articles

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated using reverse substitution techniques, without human labeling.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Top-k recall
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Top-k recall is calculated as the number of diagnosis codes present in the top k predictions of the model divided by the total number of diagnosis codes in that admission.

**Interpretation**: Higher top-k recall values indicate better performance of models at predicting relevant diagnoses.

**Baseline Results**: LSTM: 82.80% test accuracy (pre-trained), ELECTRA: 84.43% test accuracy (pre-trained)

**Validation**: N/A

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
