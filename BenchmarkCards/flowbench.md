**Tasks**:
- Workflow Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: ComfyUI community websites through web crawling.

**Size**: 13,571 workflow-description pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual refinement and filtering

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Pass Accuracy (PA)
- Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA)
- Format Validation (FV)
- Pass Node Diversity (PND)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated by evaluating the performance of generated workflows against specified criteria, such as execution success and instruction alignment.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in generating accurate and diverse workflows.

**Validation**: The model's performance is validated against predefined metrics established in the FlowBench dataset.
