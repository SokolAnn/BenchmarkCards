# LLMA RENA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLMA RENA

**Overview**: LLMA RENA is a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLMs in multi-agent dynamic environments. It encompasses seven distinct gaming environments and uses TrueSkill‚Ñ¢ scoring to assess various abilities of LLM agents.

**Data Type**: gameplay interactions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- AgentBench
- SmartPlay

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/path_to_llmarepo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in dynamic multi-agent environments.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Strategic Planning
- Team Collaboration
- Numerical Reasoning
- Opponent Modeling
- Communication

**Limitations**: While LLMA RENA focuses on multi-agent interactions, it does not cover capabilities in video and audio modalities.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Developed using PettingZoo as a foundation for multi-agent dynamic environments.
