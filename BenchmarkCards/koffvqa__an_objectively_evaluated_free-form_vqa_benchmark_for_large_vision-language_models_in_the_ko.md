- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Images are sourced from various online repositories, including the Open Images v7 dataset and the KAIST Scene Text dataset, along with curated questions.

**Size**: 275 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Questions and grading criteria are created by human annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Scores are computed based on predefined grading criteria, with evaluations scaled from 0 to 10, and then transformed to a range of 0 to 100.

**Interpretation**: Higher average scores indicate better performance, which is directly comparable with other benchmarks.

**Validation**: Evaluation compared against human scores for accuracy.
