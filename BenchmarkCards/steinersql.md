## üíæ Data

**Source**: LogicCat, Spider, Spider2.0-Lite, BIRD

**Size**: 10,181 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Execution Accuracy measurement
- Multi-level Validation

**Metrics**:
- Execution Accuracy

**Calculation**: Execution Accuracy is calculated by determining if the execution result of the generated SQL query matches that of the ground-truth query.

**Interpretation**: Higher execution accuracy indicates better performance in generating correct SQL queries.

**Baseline Results**: SteinerSQL achieved 36.10% execution accuracy on LogicCat and 40.04% on Spider2.0-Lite.

**Validation**: The framework employs a multi-level validation process to ensure the correctness of SQL queries.
