# CogBench

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: CogBench

**Overview**: CogBench is the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment using a multimodal pipeline across English and Mandarin datasets.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English
- Mandarin

**Resources**:

- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/name)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness of AI models in cognitive impairment classification using speech input.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Cognitive Impairment Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: CIR-E, ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021 datasets for evaluating cognitive impairment assessment.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Data was collected from naturalistic community settings and evaluated by neurologists.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Macro-F1

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model predictions against the ground truth labels from cognitive assessments.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores indicate better performance of models in classifying cognitive impairment.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets with varying difficulty levels.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
