# LangProBe (Language Programs Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LangProBe (Language Programs Benchmark)

**Overview**: LangProBe is a large-scale benchmark for evaluating the architectures and optimization strategies for language programs, with over 2000 combinations of tasks, architectures, optimizers, and choices of language models.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/username/repository)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate combinations of language models, program architectures, and their optimizers, and to study the impact on cost-performance trade-offs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Multi-label Classification
- Text Generation
- Question Answering
- Mathematical Reasoning

**Limitations**: Due to compute constraints, LangProBe does not include more language programs and datasets.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various open-sourced datasets including MMLU, HotPotQA, and more.

**Size**: 2000+ configurations with multiple datasets

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Empirical evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Cost-Performance Ratio

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the total inference cost and performance scores.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores with lower costs indicate better performing configurations.

**Baseline Results**: Raw model predictions serve as baseline comparisons.

**Validation**: Evaluated through extensive experiments across various configurations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
