# MVGBench: a Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-view Generation Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MVGBench: a Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-view Generation Models

**Overview**: MVGBench is a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture, image quality, and semantics. It allows fair comparison of existing MVGs and systematically analyzes different models to identify critical design choices.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/MVGBench/)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a rigorous benchmarking suite for evaluating multi-view generation models, enabling systematic analysis and understanding of their performance.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Image Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated datasets including Google Scanned Objects (GSO) and OmniObject3D (Omni3D) for evaluation.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated for frontal view and elevation angles.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Chamfer Distance (CD)
- cPSNR
- cSSIM
- cLPIPS
- oFID
- IQ-vlm

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on comparisons between generated multi-view images, focusing on their 3D consistency and semantics.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better 3D geometric consistency, image quality, and semantic alignment with ground truth attributes. Scores are normalized for meaningful comparison.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The proposed metrics were validated through user studies and comparisons with existing methods.
