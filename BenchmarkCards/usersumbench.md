## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for user summarization techniques, facilitating the development of improved LLM-based summarization models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- User Summarization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: User activity data from MovieLens, Yelp, and Amazon Review datasets.

**Size**: 6,046 examples

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quality Metric
- Instruction Following Metric
- Information Density Metric

**Metrics**:
- Quality Metric
- Instruction Following Metric
- Information Density Metric

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated by assessing the predictive accuracy of generated summaries in forecasting future user activities.

**Interpretation**: Metrics indicate how well summaries capture user information and predict behaviors; higher values correspond to better alignment with human evaluations.

**Baseline Results**: The time-hierarchical and self-critique method serves as a strong baseline for evaluating summarization approaches.

**Validation**: Metrics validated against human ratings across various datasets.
