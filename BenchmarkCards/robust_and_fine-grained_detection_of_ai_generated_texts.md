## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a robust dataset for detecting AI-generated texts across various domains and languages.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Token Classification

**Limitations**: No detector can guarantee 100% accuracy, and models are meant for human-in-the-loop scenarios.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: An extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts from various popular LLMs.

**Size**: 2,447,221 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated with human oversight where necessary.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
