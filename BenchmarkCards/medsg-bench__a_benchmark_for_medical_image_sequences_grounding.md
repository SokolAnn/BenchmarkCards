# MedSG-Bench: A Benchmark for Medical Image Sequences Grounding

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MedSG-Bench: A Benchmark for Medical Image Sequences Grounding

**Overview**: MedSG-Bench is the first benchmark tailored for Medical Image Sequences Grounding, comprising eight VQA-style tasks and totaling 9,630 question-answer pairs. It aims to evaluate the grounding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in sequential medical imaging scenarios.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of MedSG-Bench is to evaluate the fine-grained visual grounding capabilities of MLLMs in medical image sequences.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Medical Professionals
- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Image Difference Grounding
- Image Consistency Grounding
- Multi-View Grounding
- Object Tracking
- Visual Concept Grounding
- Visual Patch Grounding
- Cross-modal Grounding
- Referring Grounding

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 76 publicly available medical imaging datasets under permissive licenses.

**Size**: 9,630 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotations provided within the datasets.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Accuracy at IoU threshold 0.5 (Acc@0.5)

**Calculation**: IoU is calculated as the area of overlap between the predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes divided by the area of their union.

**Interpretation**: Higher IoU and Acc@0.5 scores indicate better model performance in localizing and grounding the medical image sequences.

**Validation**: The benchmark was validated through evaluations of both general-purpose and medical-domain specialized MLLMs.
