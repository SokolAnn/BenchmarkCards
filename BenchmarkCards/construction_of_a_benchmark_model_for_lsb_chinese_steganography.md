# Construction of a Benchmark Model for LSB Chinese Steganography

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Construction of a Benchmark Model for LSB Chinese Steganography

**Overview**: This study proposes a new method combining image steganography technology with Natural Language Processing (NLP) models aimed at improving the accuracy and robustness of extracting steganographic text. The method integrates error detection, correction, and semantic analysis for better information recovery.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To explore the issues of steganography and extraction of Chinese text, proposing an innovative LSB-NLP framework.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in Steganography
- NLP Researchers
- Data Security Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Extraction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The data consists of Chinese text encoded in binary format for embedding into images using LSB steganography.

**Size**: 10,000 characters

**Format**: Binary data embedded in images

**Annotation**: Data is not explicitly annotated; it is implicitly structured through the encoding and embedding process.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Experimental evaluation
- Comparative analysis with traditional methods

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Mean Square Error (MSE)

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated as the ratio of correctly extracted characters to the total characters. MSE is computed for pixel-level differences.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and lower MSE indicate better performance in steganographic text extraction.

**Baseline Results**: The extraction accuracy reached 100%, and MSE value was 0.2268.

**Validation**: The framework was tested using various test images to evaluate its performance.
