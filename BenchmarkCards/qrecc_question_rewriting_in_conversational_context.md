## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a large-scale resource for developing and evaluating methods for end-to-end, open-domain conversational question answering.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Question Rewriting
- Passage Retrieval

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Human-annotated conversations from web searches, combined with passages from the Common Crawl and the Wayback Machine.

**Size**: 14,000 conversations, 80,000 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotations were produced by human annotators who generated question rewrites and identified relevant web pages for answers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Exact Match
- ROUGE

**Calculation**: Metrics were calculated based on the alignment of predicted answers with the ground truth answers found in the annotations.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in retrieving relevant answers and generating accurate question rewrites.

**Baseline Results**: End-to-end QA model achieved an F1 score of 19.10 with a human upper bound of 75.45.

**Validation**: The dataset was evaluated through a systematic approach comparing various metrics to establish baselines.
