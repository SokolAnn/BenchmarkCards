# SolBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SolBench

**Overview**: SolBench is a benchmark for evaluating the functional correctness of Solidity smart contracts generated by code completion models, consisting of 4,178 functions from 1,155 Ethereum-deployed contracts.

**Data Type**: function definitions

**Domains**:
- Blockchain

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HumanEval
- APPS
- MBPP
- DS-1000

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the Solidity coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by evaluating their functional correctness in smart contract code completion.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Blockchain Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Completion
- Code Repair

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from Ethereum smart contracts using Etherscan and filtered for unique and active contracts.

**Size**: 4,178 functions

**Format**: Solidity source code

**Annotation**: Automated functional correctness verification via differential fuzzing.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Differential fuzzing
- Code generation
- Code repair

**Metrics**:
- Functional correctness
- Pass rate

**Calculation**: Functional correctness is verified by checking if completed functions produce correct outputs with the same inputs.

**Interpretation**: A higher pass rate indicates better performance in functional correctness for Solidity code completion by models.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluated using various closed-source and open-source LLMs.
