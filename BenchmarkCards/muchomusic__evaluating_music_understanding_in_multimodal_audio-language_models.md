## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate music understanding capabilities in Audio LLMs through a standardized multiple-choice format.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Music Information Retrieval Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The benchmark may not fully represent all genres and cultural contexts of music.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: MusicCaps and Song Describer Dataset

**Size**: 1,187 questions

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Validated by human annotators

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation of performance through accuracy and instruction-following rate

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Instruction Following Rate (IFR)

**Calculation**: Percentage of correctly answered questions and generated answers that correspond to given options.

**Interpretation**: A higher accuracy indicates better music understanding, while IFR measures the appropriateness of the responses generated by models.

**Validation**: Questions validated through human annotators before final inclusion.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
