# Telugu-English and Nepali-English Datasets for Abusive Language Detection

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Telugu-English and Nepali-English Datasets for Abusive Language Detection

**Overview**: This paper introduces a manually annotated dataset of 2,000 Telugu-English and 5,000 Nepali-English code-mixed comments, categorized as abusive and non-abusive, for detecting abusive language in multilingual social media.

**Data Type**: code-mixed comments

**Domains**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To address the scarcity of resources for abusive language detection in low-resource, code-mixed language contexts by providing a valuable linguistic dataset.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Abusive Language Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Comments collected from social media platforms like Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.

**Size**: 7,000 comments

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by individuals fluent in English and either Telugu or Nepali.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Logistic Regression
