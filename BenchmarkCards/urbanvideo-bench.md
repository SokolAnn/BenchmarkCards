## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the UrbanVideo-Bench benchmark is to evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of video-large language models (Video-LLMs) during navigation and interaction with dynamic urban environments.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Recall
- Perception
- Reasoning
- Navigation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset includes video data collected from real cities in Guangdong Province, China, and two simulated environments, EmbodiedCity and AerialVLN.

**Size**: 1,547 video clips and 5.2k multiple-choice questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated and generated through a pipeline utilizing LMMs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the proportion of correct answers to multiple-choice questions across the tasks.

**Interpretation**: An accuracy score reflects the performance of Video-LLMs in navigating urban environments, with higher scores indicating better performance and understanding of the tasks.

**Baseline Results**: 17 popular Video-LLMs were evaluated with Qwen-VL-Max achieving the highest accuracy at 45.5%.

**Validation**: Results were validated through correlation analysis of task performance among Video-LLMs.
