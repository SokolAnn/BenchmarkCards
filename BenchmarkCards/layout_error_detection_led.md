# Layout Error Detection (LED)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Layout Error Detection (LED)

**Overview**: LED is a benchmark designed to evaluate the structural robustness of document layout predictions by diagnosing structural layout errors. It includes a taxonomy of eight standardized error types and three tasks: error existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type classification.

**Data Type**: synthetic document layout error detection

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The LED benchmark aims to provide a formalized evaluation method for diagnosing layout errors in document analysis tasks, addressing limitations of traditional metrics.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Error Detection
- Error Type Classification
- Element-wise Error Classification

**Limitations**: LED evaluates model outputs without considering their original detection quality, making it hard to isolate whether errors stem from recognition or reasoning failures.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic dataset generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical distributions from DLA models.

**Size**: 4,996 document images and approximately 70,000 layout elements

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: COCO-style annotations including bounding box coordinates and category IDs for each layout element.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the distinction of layout error types as per LED tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in structural error detection and classification by models.

**Validation**: Validation was performed by assessing model outputs across the defined LED tasks under uniform experimental conditions.
