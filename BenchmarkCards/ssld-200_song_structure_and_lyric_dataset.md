## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized dataset for evaluating structured lyrics recognition models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Lyric Recognition
- Structure Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Songs collected from YouTube, containing both audio and corresponding lyrics.

**Size**: 200 songs, total duration of 13.9 hours

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotations of structure and lyrics for each song.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Diarization Error Rate (DER)
