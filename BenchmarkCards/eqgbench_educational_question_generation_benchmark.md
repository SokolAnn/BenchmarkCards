# EQGBench (Educational Question Generation Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: EQGBench (Educational Question Generation Benchmark)

**Overview**: EQGBench is a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs‚Äô performance in Chinese Educational Question Generation (EQG), consisting of 900 evaluation samples spanning three middle school disciplines: mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

**Data Type**: question-generation pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Education

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of EQGBench is to evaluate the ability of models to generate high-quality educational questions that align with pedagogical goals.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Educators
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Structured user instructions generated through a three-step template process involving initial instruction design by teachers, parameterization, and dynamic information filling.

**Size**: 900 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual review by experienced teachers ensuring quality and applicability.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation using LLM-based scoring
- Human evaluation for validation

**Metrics**:
