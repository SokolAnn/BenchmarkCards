# Uhura

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Uhura

**Overview**: Uhura is a new benchmark designed to evaluate LMs‚Äô scientific knowledge and truthfulness in six low-resource African languages, consisting of two tasks: Uhura-ARC-Easy (multiple-choice science questions) and Uhura-TruthfulQA (evaluating truthfulness on various topics).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Amharic
- Hausa
- Northern Sotho
- Swahili
- Yoruba
- Zulu

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge)
- TruthfulQA

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the performance of language models on scientific knowledge and truthfulness in low-resource African languages.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Language Model Developers
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset was created via human translation of established benchmarks (ARC-Easy and TruthfulQA).

**Size**: Approximately 1,200 questions per language for ARC-Easy and up to 817 questions for TruthfulQA.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Translations were conducted by professional translators, with quality control by language coordinators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Zero-shot prompting
- Five-shot prompting

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the proportion of correctly answered questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance of language models in understanding and responding to questions in low-resource African languages.

**Baseline Results**: Closed models consistently outperformed open models, with specific accuracies reported in the evaluation results.

**Validation**: N/A
