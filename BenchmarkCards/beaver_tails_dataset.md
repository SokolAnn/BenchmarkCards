# BEAVER TAILS dataset

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BEAVER TAILS dataset

**Overview**: We introduce the BEAVER TAILS dataset, aimed at fostering research on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs). This dataset uniquely separates annotations of helpfulness and harmlessness for question-answering pairs. In total, we have gathered safety meta-labels for 333,963 question-answer (QA) pairs and 361,903 pairs of expert comparison data for both the helpfulness and harmlessness metrics. The dataset provides annotations across 14 harm categories and two sets of human-preference rankings (helpfulness and harmlessness).

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Facilitate safety alignment research for large language models by providing QA pairs annotated with safety meta-labels across 14 harm categories and separate human-preference ranking data for helpfulness and harmlessness.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- LLM Safety Researchers
- Domain Experts working on alignment and content moderation

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Content Moderation
- Preference Ranking
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

**Limitations**: The authors state limited demographic diversity among crowdworkers may narrow representation of human preference; the 14 harm categories may not cover all harm types and exhibit overlap; some categories (e.g., Child Abuse, Animal Abuse) are imbalanced and underrepresented. The authors acknowledge the dataset could theoretically be used maliciously.

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- the same dataset could theoretically be used to train AI assistants in a harmful or malicious manner

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Red-team prompts derived from the HH RED-TEAM dataset and Safety-Prompts; responses were generated using Alpaca-7B for BEAVER TAILS -30k; dataset iterations include BEAVER TAILS -30k and BEAVER TAILS -330k. Annotations collected from a team of over 70 crowdworkers; quality control performed by AIJet QC team and the research team.

**Size**: BEAVER TAILS -30k: Annotated 30,207 QA-pairs (30,144 pairs of human-preference annotations). BEAVER TAILS -330k: Annotated 333,963 QA pairs; 16,851 unique prompts; 99,734 unique QA pairs; 361,903 pairs of human-preference annotations. Inter-crowdworker agreement rates: safety meta-label = 81.68%, helpfulness preference = 62.39%, harmlessness = 60.91%.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Two-stage annotation by crowdworkers (70+): Stage 1 - multi-classification across 14 harm categories to assign a safety meta-label (safe/unsafe); Stage 2 - ranking responses per prompt separately for harmlessness and helpfulness. Annotators had college-level education and proficiency in English. Annotations reviewed by AIJet QC team and the research team. Annotators provided confidence scores on a 0-3 scale.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation (crowdworkers)
- QA-moderation model (automated content moderation trained on dataset)
- GPT-4 prompted evaluation
- Bradley-Terry preference modeling for pairwise comparisons
- Training Reward and Cost models (model-based evaluation)
- Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback using PPO-Lagrangian
- Ablation studies

**Metrics**:
- Inter-annotator Agreement (safety meta-label = 81.68%, helpfulness = 62.39%, harmlessness = 60.91%)
- Accuracy (Reward Model Accuracy = 78.13%)
- Sign Accuracy (Cost Model Sign Accuracy = 95.62%)
- Preference Accuracy (Cost Model Preference Accuracy = 74.37%)
- Model win rates as evaluated by prompted GPT-4 (e.g., Safe-RLHF Helpfulness 85.57%, Harmlessness 82.57%)

**Calculation**: Train-test split of 9:1 for training reward and cost models. Preference modeling uses the Bradley-Terry formulation with negative log-likelihood loss (explicit equations provided). Reward and cost are scalar predictions assigned to the last EOS token. Cost sign used: -1 for safe text, +1 for unsafe text.

**Interpretation**: Distinct separation between safe and unsafe cost score distributions validates the cost model. Higher inter-annotator agreement indicates alignment between annotators and research team. Decoupling helpfulness and harmlessness in human preferences yields measurable performance benefits for safety alignment when compared to single-dimensional preference data.

**Baseline Results**: Reward Model Accuracy: 78.13%. Cost Model Sign Accuracy: 95.62%. Cost Model Preference Accuracy: 74.37%. Ablation/Table 2: Safe-RLHF win rates against Alpaca-7B (evaluated by prompted GPT-4) - Helpfulness: 85.57%, Harmlessness: 82.57%.

**Validation**: Validation via a 9:1 train-test split for static preference models; quality control pipeline where AIJet QC and research team inspect batches (sample at least 10% with minimum 90% agreement for acceptance); inter-annotator agreement reported; evaluations include human, GPT-4, and QA-moderation model comparisons; ablation studies to assess methods.
