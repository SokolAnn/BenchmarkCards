# Swahili Question Answering (QA) Benchmark Dataset

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Swahili Question Answering (QA) Benchmark Dataset

**Overview**: This paper proposes the creation of a Swahili Question Answering (QA) benchmark dataset, aimed at addressing the underrepresentation of Swahili in natural language processing (NLP). The dataset will focus on providing high-quality, annotated question-answer pairs that capture the linguistic diversity and complexity of Swahili.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Swahili

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- SQuAD
- GLUE
- KenSwQuAD
- KLUE

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a robust benchmark for assessing the performance of Swahili natural language processing models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from a diverse set of high-quality Swahili-language sources, including primary data from Swahili speakers, secondary data from existing datasets, and crowd-sourced contributions.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation with crowdsourcing and expert review.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Exact Match (EM)
- BLEU Score

**Calculation**: Evaluation metrics such as F1 and EM will be adapted for the specific linguistic properties of Swahili.

**Interpretation**: Models should be able to produce accurate responses that match the correct answers derived from the dataset, as evaluated by EM and F1 metrics.

**Baseline Results**: Initial baselines will include multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-R.

**Validation**: Expert review and inter-annotator agreement checks will ensure the quality of annotations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Privacy
- Ethical considerations

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias, Output bias
- **Privacy**: Personal information in data

**Demographic Analysis**: The dataset intends to include a wide range of perspectives and experiences from diverse Swahili-speaking populations.

**Potential Harm**: ['Language bias', 'Cultural misrepresentation']

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: The dataset will adhere to strict privacy standards to ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is included.

**Data Licensing**: Not Applicable

**Consent Procedures**: Explicit consent will be obtained for the use of information collected directly from individuals.

**Compliance With Regulations**: The dataset will comply with local and international data protection laws.
