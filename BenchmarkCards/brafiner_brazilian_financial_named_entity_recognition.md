## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BraFiNER (Brazilian Financial Named Entity Recognition)

**Overview**: Development of the BraFiNER, a Portuguese dataset for Named Entity Recognition in finance, using earnings call transcripts from Brazilian banks.

**Data Type**: annotated sentences

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Finance

**Languages**:
- Portuguese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rsabilio/NerEval-BrazilianCorporateTranscripts)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate mono- and multilingual transformer models for Named Entity Recognition in Brazilian financial texts.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Named Entity Recognition

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Earnings call transcripts of Brazilian banks from the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios (CVM) open data.

**Size**: 384 transcripts, 57,933 annotated sentences
