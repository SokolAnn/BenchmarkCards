## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve intra-operative decision-making and facilitate intuitive surgeon-AI interaction using the PitVQA dataset.

**Target Audience**:
- Medical Researchers
- Surgeons
- Machine Learning Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 25 procedural videos of endoscopic pituitary surgeries from The National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK.

**Size**: 884,242 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated collaboratively by 2 neurosurgical residents with operative experience and checked by an attending neurosurgeon.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Balanced Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

**Metrics**:
- Balanced Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Balanced accuracy is computed by equally weighting the contribution of each class, particularly effective for imbalanced datasets.

**Interpretation**: Higher balanced accuracy indicates better model performance across various classes.

**Baseline Results**: Balanced accuracy of 58.82% on PitVQA dataset, showing improvements over previous models.

**Validation**: Validated against both the PitVQA dataset and EndoVis18-VQA dataset.
