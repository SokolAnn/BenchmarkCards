# Medical AI Consensus: A Multi-Agent Framework for Radiology Report Generation and Evaluation

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Medical AI Consensus: A Multi-Agent Framework for Radiology Report Generation and Evaluation

**Overview**: The proposed framework serves as both a benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the radiology ecosystem, integrating large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) through a modular architecture composed of ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction, report generation, review, and evaluation.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17353)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a multi-agent benchmarking framework designed to evaluate LLMs and LVMs throughout an end-to-end pipeline of radiology report generation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Medical Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Report Generation
- Image Analysis
- Clinical Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated benchmark dataset of multisequence brain MRI scans from cancer patients, annotated by board-certified radiologists.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated under the supervision of board-certified radiologists.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- ROUGE
- Clinical Accuracy
- Readability

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated using various standard classification and segmentation metrics.
