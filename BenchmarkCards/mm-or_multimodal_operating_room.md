# MM-OR (Multimodal Operating Room)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MM-OR (Multimodal Operating Room)

**Overview**: MM-OR is a realistic and large-scale multimodal spatio-temporal dataset designed to advance operating room modeling and enable multimodal scene graph generation.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/egeozsoy/MM-OR)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive resource for studying robotic-assisted surgical workflows and advance operating room modeling.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Robotics Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Scene Graph Generation
- Sterility Breach Detection
- Next Action Anticipation
