# TelcoLM (Telecommunication Language Models)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TelcoLM (Telecommunication Language Models)

**Overview**: This paper presents a comprehensive effort to collect a large corpus of domain-specific data (800M tokens, 80K instructions), adapt large language models for the telecommunication domain, and benchmark their performance against generalist models across various downstream tasks.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- TeleQnA

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15891)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To design an efficient approach for adapting language models to the telecommunication domain and evaluate their performance.

**Target Audience**:
- Machine Learning Researchers
- Telecommunication Professionals

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Multiple-Choice Question Answering
- Abstract Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The telco dataset is extracted from publicly available resources including technical specifications, research papers, and various web sources.

**Size**: 800M tokens

**Format**: Plain text

**Annotation**: Automatically generated from instruction sets and existing datasets.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Domain Adaptation
- Instruction Tuning

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Perplexity
- ROUGE
- METEOR

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the performance of models on telco and general domain tasks during benchmarking.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and lower perplexity indicate better model adaptation to the telco domain.

**Baseline Results**: The baseline model is Llama-2-7B.

**Validation**: Models are evaluated against various adapted and unadapted version benchmarks.
