# JDocQA (Japanese Document Question Answering)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: JDocQA (Japanese Document Question Answering)

**Overview**: JDocQA is a large-scale document-based QA dataset, requiring both visual and textual information to answer questions. It comprises 5,504 documents in PDF format and 11,600 annotated question-and-answer instances in Japanese.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Japanese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19454)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for generative language models to effectively perform question answering on Japanese documents incorporating both visual and textual information.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Japanese documents collected from open-access sources including governmental and public documents.

**Size**: 5,504 documents and 11,600 question-and-answer pairs

**Format**: PDF

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by 43 annotators, including multiple question categories and unanswerable questions.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
