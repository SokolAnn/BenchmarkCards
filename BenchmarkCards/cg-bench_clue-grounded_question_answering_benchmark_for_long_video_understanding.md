## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models in understanding long videos through clue-grounded question answering.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Manually collected videos from the internet, categorizing into a systematic tagging framework.

**Size**: 1,219 videos and 12,129 QAC triplets

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated QAC triplets by watching entire videos and selecting relevant clues.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Clue-grounded white box evaluation
- Clue-grounded black box evaluation
- Multiple-choice question evaluation
- Open-ended question answering evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- mIoU (Mean Intersection over Union)
