# VoxEval

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VoxEval

**Overview**: VoxEval is a novel SpeechQA benchmark designed to evaluate the knowledge understanding capabilities of End-to-End Spoken Language Models (SLMs) through pure speech interactions, accounting for varied input audio conditions and tackling complex tasks like mathematical reasoning in spoken format.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMLU

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dreamtheater123/VoxEval)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To benchmark the knowledge understanding capabilities of spoken language models across diverse audio conditions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The VoxEval benchmark focuses exclusively on assessing the robustness of SLMs in terms of knowledge understanding, leaving out other critical aspects such as fairness, toxicity, and hallucination.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The benchmark data is constructed based on the MMLU test set transformed into speech format using the OpenAI Text-to-Speech API.

**Size**: 13,938 unique SpeechQA pairs

**Format**: Audio

**Annotation**: Data is generated using text-to-speech transformation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is computed based on the responses generated by SLMs after converting speech to text using the OpenAI ASR model.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in understanding and responding to spoken questions.

**Baseline Results**: GLM-4-Voice was the only model that exceeded random guessing, which is an accuracy of 25%.

**Validation**: Systematic evaluation with several recent SLMs indicates significant challenges posed by VoxEval.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:

- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Robustness**: Prompt injection attack

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: N/A
