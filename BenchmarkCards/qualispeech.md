# QualiSpeech

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: QualiSpeech

**Overview**: QualiSpeech is a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset that includes detailed natural language descriptions, enabling richer insights into speech qualities compared to traditional numerical scoring methods.

**Data Type**: speech quality assessment with natural language descriptions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- NISQA
- BVCC

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/QualiSpeech)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for evaluating the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs).

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Speech Processing Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Speech Quality Assessment

**Limitations**: The dataset may not cover all possible aspects of speech quality, and annotations are derived from a single listener per sample, which may affect score reliability.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset includes diverse synthetic and real speech samples sourced from the BVCC dataset, NISQA, and other synthetic speech models.

**Size**: 10,558 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: The data is annotated by a single listener, generating scores and natural language descriptions for various low-level speech aspects.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
- Precision
- Recall
- Intersection over Union (IoU)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated to assess the accuracy of the scores and the relevance of descriptions generated by auditory LLMs.

**Interpretation**: Scores closer to 1 indicate better performance in predicting speech quality and the accuracy of natural language assessments.

**Validation**: The performance of models is validated against human evaluations and compared with traditional metrics like MOS.
