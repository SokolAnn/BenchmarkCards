# MEDFACT (A Large-scale Chinese Dataset for Evidence-based Medical Fact-checking of LLM Responses)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MEDFACT (A Large-scale Chinese Dataset for Evidence-based Medical Fact-checking of LLM Responses)

**Overview**: MEDFACT is the first evidence-based Chinese medical fact-checking dataset for LLM-generated medical content, consisting of 1,321 questions and 7,409 claims, intended to improve the reliability of medical information generated by language models.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AshleyChenNLP/MedFact)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for the evaluation and training of models in the medical fact-checking domain, specifically targeting LLM-generated content.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Fact Checking

**Limitations**: The dataset is limited to Chinese medical content and exhibits imbalanced label distribution.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from medical questions sourced from the webMedQA dataset with LLM-generated responses.

**Size**: 1,321 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated through an 'LLM-then-Human' approach with independent reviews by trained annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model predictions against the ground truth veracity labels.

**Interpretation**: Higher F1 score signifies better classification of claims into supported and refuted categories.

**Validation**: Inter-Annotator Agreement measured by Cohen‚Äôs Kappa of 81.54%.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
