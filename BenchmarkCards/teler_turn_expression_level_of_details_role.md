# TELeR (Turn, Expression, Level of Details, Role)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TELeR (Turn, Expression, Level of Details, Role)

**Overview**: A general taxonomy (TELeR) to design and categorize LLM prompts along Turn, Expression, Level of Details, and Role to enable standardized prompt reporting and meaningful comparisons in benchmarking LLMs on ill-defined complex tasks.

**Data Type**: text (prompts and input texts such as reviewer comments and alternative narratives)

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Introduce a general taxonomy (TELeR) to categorize prompts to enable standardized prompt reporting and meaningful comparisons when benchmarking LLMs on complex tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Developers

**Tasks**:
- Summarization
- Story Generation
- Text Generation

**Limitations**: The proposed TELeR taxonomy is exclusively applicable to LLM prompts targeted toward solving a complex task. The seven levels do not apply to simple tasks. The taxonomy should not be considered an ultimate taxonomy and can be extended.

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Simple tasks (TELeR seven levels do not apply to simple tasks)
