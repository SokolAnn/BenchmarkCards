## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To advance research in long-context summarization by providing a reliable evaluation benchmark for large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Summarization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A newly collected corpus of 103 books from Chinese Internet open-source data, featuring 695 samples in total.

**Size**: 695 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotations were completed by human experts with assistance from LLMs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- ROUGE-L

**Calculation**: ROUGE-L is calculated based on the output of the models against reference summaries, measuring the overlap of tokens between them.

**Interpretation**: Higher ROUGE-L scores indicate better summarization performance and alignment with human preferences.

**Baseline Results**: Performance gaps were noted across different model versions, highlighting challenges in long-context summarization.

**Validation**: Tested for reliability with diverse prompts and human assessments.
