# DIVKNOW QA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: DIVKNOW QA

**Overview**: DIVKNOW QA is a novel fact-centric multi-hop question-answering benchmark that requires models to utilize heterogeneous knowledge sources equitably to answer a question. It assesses the reasoning ability of LLMs via jointly exploiting open-domain QA over heterogeneous knowledge sources.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs
