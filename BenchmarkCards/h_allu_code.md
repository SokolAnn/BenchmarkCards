## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the performance of code LLMs in recognizing hallucinations and develop effective techniques for their detection and mitigation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Hallucination Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated from the Code Alpaca dataset, which contains instruction-following data for code generation.

**Size**: 5,663 code generation tasks

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually analyzed by annotators with programming experience to identify hallucinations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy of Hallucination Existence Recognition
- Accuracy of Hallucination Type Recognition
- Accuracy of Hallucination Mitigation

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the percentage of correctly identified hallucinations and their types in the generated code.

**Interpretation**: Higher rates indicate better performance in recognizing and mitigating hallucinations.

**Baseline Results**: ChatGPT achieved a hallucination recognition accuracy of over 89%.

**Validation**: Validated through experiments with various state-of-the-art code LLMs.
