## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA

**Overview**: The Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA datasets are specifically designed to study the knowledge acquisition capabilities of large language models (LLMs) related to memorization, extraction, and reasoning.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- N/A

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zhangxy-2019/Effective-Knowledge-Injection)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To explore the knowledge acquisition capabilities of LLMs through self-teaching via newly curated datasets.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Knowledge Memorization
- Knowledge Extraction
- Natural Language Inference

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected articles from Wikipedia NewPages published after the pre-training cut-off time of the LLMs.

**Size**: 4,257 articles

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Generated QA pairs using prompts for open-ended generation and natural language inference tasks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Exact Match (EM)
