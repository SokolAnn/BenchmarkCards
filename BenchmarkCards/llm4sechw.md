# LLM4SecHW

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLM4SecHW

**Overview**: This paper presents a novel framework LLM4SecHW for hardware debugging that leverages domain-specific Large Language Models and compiles a dataset of open-source hardware design defects and their remediation steps, utilizing version control data. This dataset addresses the scarcity of functional hardware data and provides a substantial foundation for training machine learning models.

**Data Type**: hardware design files with bug information

**Domains**:
- Hardware
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To automate the identification and rectification of hardware design bugs using domain-specific large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in Hardware Debugging
- Machine Learning Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Bug Localization
- Bug Repair

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Dataset constructed from version control information of notable open-source hardware designs retrieved from GitHub.

**Size**: 15,000 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Filtered and processed version control data with pre- and post-correction hardware design files.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Fine-tuning of Large Language Models
- Evaluation on Bug Localization and Bug Repair tasks

**Metrics**:
- ROUGE-1 F1 Score
- ROUGE-2 F1 Score
- ROUGE-L F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the direct n-gram overlap between model outputs and reference outputs.

**Interpretation**: Higher ROUGE scores indicate better performance in identifying and repairing bugs.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Models evaluated on a testing set of hardware designs.
