## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To promote few-shot learning research in NLP by providing a unified benchmark for joint multi-task language understanding.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Intent Detection
- Slot Tagging

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real user utterances from the AIUI open dialogue platform of iFlytek and utterances written by workers.

**Size**: 6,694 utterances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Intent and slot labels annotated by workers with validation.

## üî¨ Methodology
