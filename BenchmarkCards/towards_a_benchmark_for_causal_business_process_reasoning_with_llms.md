# Towards a Benchmark for Causal Business Process Reasoning with LLMs

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Towards a Benchmark for Causal Business Process Reasoning with LLMs

**Overview**: This work develops a benchmark to assess the ability of LLMs to reason about causal and process perspectives of business operations, which are referred to as Causally-augmented Business Processes (BPC). It includes a set of situations, questions, and deductive rules for assessing LLMs' reasoning abilities.
