# RobuNFR (Robustness Evaluation of Non-Functional Requirements Aware Code Generation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: RobuNFR (Robustness Evaluation of Non-Functional Requirements Aware Code Generation)

**Overview**: RobuNFR is an automated framework that evaluates the robustness of LLMs in code generation while incorporating Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). It examines four NFR dimensions‚Äîdesign, readability, reliability, and performance‚Äîacross three methodologies: prompt variation, regression testing, and diverse workflows.

**Data Type**: code generation tasks

- Software Developers
- Machine Learning Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Code Quality Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, MBPP-ET benchmarks.

**Size**: 164 programming problems (HumanEval), 427 programming problems (MBPP)

**Format**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Prompt Variation
- Regression Testing
- NFR-Aware Code Generation Workflows

**Metrics**:
- Pass@1
- Code Smell Density
- Readability Density
- Exception Handling Density
- Execution Time

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on passing tests and performance of generated code.

**Interpretation**: Higher Pass@1 indicates better performance in functional correctness; lower code smell density indicates better design.

**Validation**: Tests against existing benchmarks to ensure consistency of results.
