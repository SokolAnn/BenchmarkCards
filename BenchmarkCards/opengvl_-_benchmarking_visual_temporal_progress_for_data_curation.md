- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Temporal Task Progress Prediction
- Data Curation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various robotics datasets including nyu door, berkeley mvp, cmu stretch, and nyu franka

**Size**: 50 episodes sampled from each dataset

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated using the Value-Order Correlation (VOC) metric

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Value-Order Correlation (VOC)

**Calculation**: VOC measures the rank correlation between predicted task completion percentages and the ground truth.

**Interpretation**: A higher VOC score indicates better alignment between predictions and actual task completion.

**Baseline Results**: Comparison to proprietary models shows open-source models achieve approximately 60-70% of the performance.

**Validation**: Benchmark validation through hidden datasets to prevent contamination.
