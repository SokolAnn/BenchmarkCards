# LLM2LAS (Large Language Model to Learning from Answer Sets)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLM2LAS (Large Language Model to Learning from Answer Sets)

**Overview**: LLM2LAS is a hybrid system that combines the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models with the rule induction power of Learning from Answer Sets (LAS) and the formal reasoning strengths of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to improve question answering capabilities by automatically learning from examples.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of LLM2LAS is to automate the learning of commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities from examples in story-based question answering tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Logic Programming Researchers
- Natural Language Processing Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Commonsense Reasoning
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: bAbI dataset from Facebook Research

**Size**: Varies by task, up to 20 tasks

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: Automatically generated symbolic representations from narrative texts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
