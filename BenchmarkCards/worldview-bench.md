# WorldView-Bench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: WorldView-Bench

**Overview**: WorldView-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity (GCI) in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews through free-form generative evaluation.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to assess cultural inclusivity biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) through open-ended questions that require generators to produce culturally diverse responses.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Developers
- Cultural Anthropologists

**Tasks**:
- Cultural Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: OpenAI's o1 model generated and human-validated questions.

**Size**: 175 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Questions were validated through a multi-stage pipeline involving automated and human validation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Zero-shot classification
- Sentiment analysis

**Metrics**:
- Perspective Distribution Score (PDS)
- PDS Entropy

**Calculation**: PDS measures the representational share of cultural perspectives extracted from LLM responses.

**Interpretation**: Higher PDS and entropy values indicate greater cultural inclusivity in LLM outputs.

**Validation**: Three-stage validation process involving automated generation, LLM-assisted evaluation, and final human validation.
