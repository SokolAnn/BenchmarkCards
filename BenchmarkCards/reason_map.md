# REASON MAP

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: REASON MAP

**Overview**: REASON MAP is a benchmark designed to evaluate the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs using high-resolution transit maps. It encompasses 1,008 human-verified question-answer pairs constructed over transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English
- Hungarian
- Chinese
- Italian

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MathVQA
- MathVerse
- VisuLogic

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a rigorous evaluation framework for assessing multimodal large language models on fine-grained visual reasoning tasks using transit maps.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Visual Reasoning
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The benchmark primarily focuses on high-resolution transit maps and may not generalize to other types of visual reasoning tasks.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: High-resolution transit maps from publicly available online sources covering 30 cities across 13 countries.

**Size**: 1,008 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation with human verification for correctness and quality.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Map Score

**Calculation**: Accuracy is evaluated based on correct route identification, while Map Score assesses the quality of the answer according to predefined criteria.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy scores indicate better model performance; Map Score reflects the overall quality of the response.

**Validation**: The benchmark validation involves manual route verification and evaluation against a structured two-level framework.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
