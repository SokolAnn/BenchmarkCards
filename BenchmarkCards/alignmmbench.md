# AlignMMBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AlignMMBench

**Overview**: AlignMMBench is a comprehensive evaluation benchmark specifically designed to assess the Chinese alignment capabilities of Vision-Language Models. It includes 1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs, covering thirteen specific tasks across three categories, incorporating both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue scenarios.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the alignment capabilities of large Vision-Language Models in Chinese contexts and provide a robust evaluation framework for future improvements in multimodal models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Image Captioning
- Visual Question Answering
- Dialogue Generation

**Limitations**: None

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from real-world scenarios and internet sources; image queries generated based on user requests.

**Size**: 4,978 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts, including a detailed two-phase review process.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation using CritiqueVLM
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Alignment score
- Mean Absolute Error

**Calculation**: Scores are generated based on the responses from the AI models compared to human annotations.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better alignment and understanding capabilities of models in the corresponding tasks.

**Baseline Results**: CritiqueVLM exceeds GPT-4 in evaluation accuracy for task completion across benchmarks

**Validation**: Internal testing dataset to assess reliability and performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
