## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VerilogDB: The Largest, Highest-Quality Dataset with a Preprocessing Framework for LLM-based RTL Generation

**Overview**: VerilogDB is a large-scale, high-quality Verilog dataset developed for training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in RTL code generation, consisting of 20,392 synthesizable Verilog modules and improving the quality and diversity of training data for hardware design automation.

**Data Type**: synthesizable Verilog modules

**Domains**:
- Hardware Design Automation

**Languages**:
- Verilog

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- VeriGen
- VerilogEval

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create a high-quality dataset for fine-tuning LLMs for better RTL code generation in hardware design.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Hardware Designers
- EDA Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- RTL Code Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data collected from GitHub, OpenCores, and academic course materials.

**Size**: 20,392 modules totaling 751 MB

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated metadata extraction and comment generation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Data collection through web scraping
- Automated preprocessing including syntax checking and synthesis validation
- Metadata extraction

**Metrics**:
