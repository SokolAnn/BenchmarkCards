# CoCo-Bench (Comprehensive Code Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CoCo-Bench (Comprehensive Code Benchmark)

**Overview**: CoCo-Bench is designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) across four critical dimensions: code understanding, code generation, code modification, and code review. It aims to provide a more holistic and objective evaluation of LLMs in software engineering by assessing their performance in practical development contexts.

**Data Type**: code snippets and tasks

**Domains**:
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- Python
- Java
- C++
- SQL

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HumanEval
- MBPP
- CodeXGLUE

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20673)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a reliable benchmark for the field of software engineering by providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Understanding
- Code Generation
- Code Modification
- Code Review

**Limitations**: The benchmark currently lacks multimodal tasks that require models to integrate code with other data types.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The code collection phase sources data primarily from Leetcode and various project repositories, ensuring relevance and quality.

**Size**: 705 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual review and validation by experienced developers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- CoCo-Score
- Difficulty-aware pass rate (DAPR)

**Calculation**: CoCo-Score is calculated based on the DAPR across different task types, weighted by task difficulty.

**Interpretation**: Higher CoCo-Scores indicate better performance, particularly in handling complex coding challenges.

**Validation**: Empirical evaluation against existing benchmarks such as HumanEval.
