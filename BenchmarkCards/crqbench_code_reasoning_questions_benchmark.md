## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a realistic benchmark for evaluating the semantic reasoning ability of language models on code reasoning tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The benchmark relies on manually curated answers which may not be verified against formal methods.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Code review comments in the CodeReviewer dataset

**Size**: 100 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Derived from contextualized code review comments using a cooperative LLM and human validation approach

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
