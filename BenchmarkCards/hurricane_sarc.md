# HURRICANE SARC

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: HURRICANE SARC

**Overview**: HURRICANE SARC is a dataset of 15,000 tweets annotated for intended sarcasm in a disaster context, specifically from hurricane events. The dataset enables the investigation of sarcasm detection using pre-trained language models.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- iSarcasm
- SARC

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To measure progress on sarcasm detection specifically in the disaster domain and to spur research on understanding sarcasm in online content during critical events.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Sarcasm Detection

**Limitations**: The label distribution in HURRICANE SARC is skewed, with non-sarcastic examples being much more prevalent than sarcastic ones.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 15,000 tweets sampled from the Twitter data repository during Hurricanes Irma, Harvey, and Maria, annotated using crowdsourcing.

**Size**: 15,000 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated by crowdsourced workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk using majority voting.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- BERTweet
- Bi-LSTM
- CNN

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall

**Calculation**: F1 Score is calculated based on true positives, false positives, and false negatives for sarcasm detection.

**Interpretation**: High F1 Score indicates better performance of sarcasm detection models.

**Baseline Results**: Best model achieved 0.70 F1 Score.

**Validation**: Models were validated using separate training, validation, and test splits.
