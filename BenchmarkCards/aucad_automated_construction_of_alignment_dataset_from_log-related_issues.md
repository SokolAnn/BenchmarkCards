# AUCAD (Automated Construction of Alignment Dataset from Log-Related Issues)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AUCAD (Automated Construction of Alignment Dataset from Log-Related Issues)

**Overview**: The AUCAD method automates the construction of a high-quality alignment dataset designed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating log statements by extracting information from log-related issues in open-source communities.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering

**Languages**:
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To construct a high-quality post-training dataset for enhancing LLM-based log statement generation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers
- Developers

**Tasks**:
- Log Statement Generation
- Data Alignment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Log-related issues extracted from the Apache open-source community and their associated GitHub commits.

**Size**: 808 entries

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically constructed and structured from log-related issues.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Experimental evaluation using alignment algorithms

**Metrics**:
- Position Accuracy (PA)
- Level Accuracy (LA)
- Message Accuracy (MA)
- Variable Precision (VP)
- Variable Recall (VR)
- Variable F1 Score (VF1)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on comparisons between generated log statements and ground truth references.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in terms of generating relevant log statements.

**Baseline Results**: Comparative evaluations against models fine-tuned without the AUCAD dataset.

**Validation**: Validated through both human and experimental evaluations.
