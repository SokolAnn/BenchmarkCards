# ChartMind: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Complex Real-world Multimodal Chart Question Answering

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ChartMind: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Complex Real-world Multimodal Chart Question Answering

**Overview**: ChartMind is a new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings, covering seven task categories, incorporating multilingual contexts, supporting open-domain textual outputs, and accommodating diverse chart formats. It bridges the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ChartQA
- OpenCQA
- Chart-to-Text

**Resources**:
