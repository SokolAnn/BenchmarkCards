# UAL-Bench (Unusual Activity Localization Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: UAL-Bench (Unusual Activity Localization Benchmark)

**Overview**: UAL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for unusual activity localization in videos, featuring three data sets: UAG-OOPS, UAG-SSBD, UAG-FunQA, and an instruction-tune dataset OOPS-UAG-Instruct to improve model capabilities.

**Data Type**: video

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate models' capabilities in localizing unusual activities in videos and to outline challenges in current methodologies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Video Activity Localization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Three datasets: UAG-OOPS, UAG-SSBD, UAG-FunQA, and one instruction-tune dataset OOPS-UAG-Instruct.

**Size**: 1,589 videos for UAG-OOPS, 75 videos for UAG-SSBD, 172 videos for UAG-FunQA, 3,778 videos for OOPS-UAG-Instruct.

**Format**: Not explicitly stated

**Annotation**: Annotations include start and end timestamps for activities.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation of Video-Language Models (Vid-LLMs)
- Instruction-tuned Vid-LLMs
- Integration of Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models (VLM-LLM)

**Metrics**:
- R@1, IoU ‚â•m
- R@1, TD‚â§p
- mTD

**Calculation**: Performance is evaluated based on the localization metrics that measure how well predicted timestamps overlap with ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher R@1 and lower mTD indicate better performance.

**Baseline Results**: Random method as a baseline which serves as a lower performance indicator.

**Validation**: Proposed evaluation protocol includes zero-shot settings.
