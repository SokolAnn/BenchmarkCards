# FEC-Bench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FEC-Bench

**Overview**: FEC-Bench is designed to assess the performance of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in dynamic facial expression captioning tasks using a newly constructed dataset of 5,033 videos and a novel evaluation metric called Temporal Event Matching (TEM).

**Data Type**: video

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Jiaxing-star/FacialDynamic)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve the ability of video MLLMs to discern and describe dynamic facial expressions in videos.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Dynamic Facial Expression Captioning
- Video Captioning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Self-collected from web scraping and extracted from existing datasets including MAFW, DFEW, AFEW, MER, CAER, FERV39K, and RAVDESS, along with additional video clips from Pexels.

**Size**: 5,033 videos

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
