## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a challenging resource for TQA research, particularly in handling open-domain, long tables and multi-domain queries.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Publicly available real estate data from major Chinese cities, including property transaction data, company financial disclosures, and land auction information.

**Size**: 20,762 question-answer pairs

**Format**: Markdown, SQL, Natural Language

**Annotation**: Automatically generated QA pairs using template-based approaches with human review and inclusion of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) labels.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- In-context learning
- Fine-tuning a BERT model

**Metrics**:
- Executable Code Ratio (ECR)
- Pass Rate (pass@1)
- Table Exact Match accuracy (Table EM)
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model outputs against the ground truth data and evaluated using precision and recall based methods.

**Interpretation**: Higher metrics indicate better model performance in answering questions related to tabular data.

**Baseline Results**: Performance comparison with baseline LLMs demonstrates significant improvements with the SLUTQA framework.

**Validation**: Validation conducted through extensive experimental results showing the effectiveness of methods.
