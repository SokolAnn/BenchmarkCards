# Jailbreak Distillation (JBDISTILL)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Jailbreak Distillation (JBDISTILL)

**Overview**: Jailbreak Distillation (JBDISTILL) is a novel benchmark construction framework that distills jailbreak attacks into high-quality and easily-updatable safety benchmarks, addressing challenges in existing safety evaluations by ensuring fair comparisons and reproducibility.

**Data Type**: safety benchmarks

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HarmBench

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://aka.ms/jailbreak-distillation)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Provide a renewable safety evaluation framework for large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Safety Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Derived prompts from existing jailbreak attack algorithms and development models.

**Size**: 500 prompts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Minimal human effort required for running the JBDISTILL pipeline to produce updated benchmarks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Prompt selection algorithms (RANK BYSUCCESS, BESTPERGOAL, COMBINED SELECTION)

**Metrics**:
- Effectiveness
- Separability
- Diversity

**Calculation**: Average Attack Success Rate (ASR) across evaluation models to measure effectiveness; confidence intervals for separability.

**Interpretation**: Effective benchmarks are those that provide high ASR and clear separability between model performances.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline benchmarks include HarmBench, DAN prompts, WildJailbreaks, showing lower effectiveness compared to JBDISTILL.

**Validation**: Empirical validation of benchmark performance across diverse LLMs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
