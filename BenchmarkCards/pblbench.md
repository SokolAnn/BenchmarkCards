## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in assessing multi-modal STEM-based Project-Based Learning outcomes.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Educators
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Project Evaluation
- Complex Reasoning

**Limitations**: The overall scale of the dataset remains limited, necessitating the collection of additional samples.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from over 500 multimodal PBL projects.

**Size**: 500 projects

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Evaluation criteria derived using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with expert-driven pairwise comparisons.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Expert evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Rank accuracy
- Average scores

**Calculation**: Rank accuracy calculated based on model's performance compared to human evaluators.

**Interpretation**: Models should closely match human scores to be considered effective.

**Baseline Results**: The highest ranked model achieved only 59% rank accuracy.

**Validation**: Results validated against human evaluators.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
