## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive dataset for the detection and analysis of cognitive distortions among Korean adolescents, facilitating targeted interventions in mental health.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Mental Health Professionals
- Education Specialists

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: Potential overlaps between different cognitive distortions; some classifications may be challenging for both models and human raters.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from the NA VER Knowledge iN platform, focusing on questions relevant to adolescent mental health.

**Size**: 108,717 instances

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Data was refined and annotated through multi-LLM negotiation and independent expert evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
