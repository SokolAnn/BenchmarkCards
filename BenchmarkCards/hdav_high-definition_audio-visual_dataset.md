## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The goal of the HDAV dataset is to provide a comprehensive resource for the training and evaluation of models in 3D human generation and audio-driven video synthesis.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- 3D Video Synthesis
- Gesture Recognition

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset consists of 3,425 online videos collected from the internet and 1,325 videos from existing datasets, which are manually annotated with detailed properties.

**Size**: 15 hours of video

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation with detailed properties such as gender and clothing type.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Video synthesis using audio inputs
- Motion generation leveraging large language models
- Diffusion-based video generation with MoE

**Metrics**:
- Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)
- Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)
- t-LPIPS

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated comparing generated video quality against ground truth and established benchmarks.

**Interpretation**: Lower values in FID and LPIPS indicate better quality, with subjective measures assessing user impressions of motion and visual fidelity.

**Validation**: The dataset is validated through comparative analysis against existing benchmarks and user studies.
