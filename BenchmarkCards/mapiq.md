# MapIQ

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MapIQ

**Overview**: MapIQ is a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs designed to gauge the map-reading capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across three map types‚Äîchoropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps‚Äîspanning six distinct themes.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Geographical Information Systems

**Languages**:
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a diverse and thematically rich benchmark dataset for evaluating the low-level map-reading capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs and understanding the influences of thematic content on model performance.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Geospatial Data Analysts
- Data Visualization Experts

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Map Reading

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, FBI Crime Data Explorer, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Size**: 14,706 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually validated questions and answers with ground truth extraction programmatically verified against geospatial metadata.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Zero-shot prompting
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Accuracy for binary questions scored as 100 (correct) or 0 (incorrect), while F1 Score used for MCQ and list-type questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better model performance in accurately answering map-related questions.

**Baseline Results**: Humans outperformed MLLMs by an average margin of 50.35% across all four experimental variables.

**Validation**: Responses validated for consistency and accuracy, ensuring model responses were formatted correctly for evaluation.
