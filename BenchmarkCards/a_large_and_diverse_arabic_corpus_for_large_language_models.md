# A Large and Diverse Arabic Corpus for Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: A Large and Diverse Arabic Corpus for Large Language Models

**Overview**: This work presents the design and development of a 500 GB high-quality Arabic corpus, comprised of 20 distinct data sources, aimed at improving cross-domain knowledge and downstream generalization capability of large language models (LLMs).

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Arabic

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Pile

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create a large Arabic corpus to train large language models (LLMs) and to assess their performance on various NLP tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Machine Reading Comprehension
- Text Summarization
- Diacritics Restoration
- Sentiment Analysis
- Part-of-speech Tagging

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The corpus consists of 20 constituent data sources, including web pages, news articles, and other content in Arabic.

**Size**: 500 GB

**Format**: Text files

**Annotation**: Data was cleaned and standardized for tokenization and later usage in training models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Fine-tuning on various NLP tasks

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Word Error Rate (WER)

**Calculation**: Metrics were calculated based on the performance of the models on specific evaluation tasks compared to baseline models.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance on the NLP tasks evaluated.

**Baseline Results**: Downstream tasks significantly improved accuracy compared to models fine-tuned on multi-lingual BERT (mBERT).

**Validation**: The benchmark was validated by assessing the performance on multiple Arabic NLP tasks.
