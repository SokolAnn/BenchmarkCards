# Spider 2.0

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Spider 2.0

**Overview**: Spider 2.0 is an evaluation framework comprising 632 real-world text-to-SQL workflow problems derived from enterprise-level database use cases, addressing complex SQL environments and multiple SQL dialects.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Spider 1.0
- BIRD

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark that reflects real-world data workflows for evaluating text-to-SQL models in enterprise applications.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text-to-SQL

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Derived from enterprise-level database use cases including Google Analytics and Salesforce, incorporating complex data transformations and SQL workflows.

**Size**: 632 problems

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Tasks are annotated by experts proficient in SQL, with a focus on ensuring complex SQL queries are executed correctly.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Execution Accuracy (EX)
- Success Rate (SR)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated through evaluation scripts determining the success of SQL queries based on execution results.

**Interpretation**: Higher metrics indicate better model performance; EX measures correctness of SQL query execution, while SR measures the overall task success rate.

**Baseline Results**: The best performance on Spider 2.0 by existing LLMs achieves only 21.3% success rate.

**Validation**: Evaluation procedures ensure rigorous testing through human validation and automated checks.
