# STEER-BENCH

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: STEER-BENCH

**Overview**: STEER-BENCH is a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering using contrasting Reddit communities. It evaluates how effectively large language models (LLMs) understand community-specific instructions and their ability to represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.

**Data Type**: instruction-response pairs, multiple-choice questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the steerability of LLMs towards diverse community perspectives and understand how they align with community-specific norms and ideologies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Reddit data collected from contrasting subreddit pairs.

**Size**: 10,000 instruction-response pairs, 5,500 multiple-choice questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Validated by human annotators for accuracy.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated as the proportion of model responses that match the silver labels generated by human annotators.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better alignment with community norms and better steerability of the model.

**Validation**: Human annotation study for question-answer pairs to ensure correct representation of community perspectives.
