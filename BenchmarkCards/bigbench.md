## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BIGbench

**Overview**: BIGbench is a unified benchmark for evaluating multi-dimensional social biases in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, featuring a carefully designed dataset of 47,040 prompts categorized across four dimensions of bias.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for identifying and analyzing social biases in T2I models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Ethics Scholars
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Bias Evaluation

**Limitations**: The benchmark's algorithm utilizes only implicit prompts for calculating the manifestation factor, which may lead to incomplete bias analysis.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed dataset consisting of 47,040 prompts, covering occupations, characteristics, and social relations.

**Size**: 47,040 prompts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Data mainly evaluated using automated alignment via a multi-modal LLM and verified through human evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Implicit bias score
- Explicit bias score
- Manifestation factor

**Calculation**: Scores are calculated based on the proportions of demographic attributes generated versus expected demographic distributions.

**Interpretation**: A higher implicit or explicit bias score indicates a lower level of bias in the model's outputs.

**Baseline Results**: The benchmark evaluated eight mainstream T2I models and three debiasing methods.

**Validation**: Human evaluations were conducted to ensure reliability, with trained evaluators assessing the generated images.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Fairness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data

**Demographic Analysis**: The benchmark includes demographic breakdowns across various bias dimensions in T2I models.

**Potential Harm**: The benchmark aims to detect and mitigate harms related to entrenched social stereotypes and biases in AI-generated content.
