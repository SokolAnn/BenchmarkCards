# CFBench (Comprehensive Constraints-Following Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CFBench (Comprehensive Constraints-Following Benchmark)

**Overview**: CFBench is a large-scale Chinese benchmark designed to evaluate constraint-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), featuring 1,000 curated samples that cover over 200 real-life scenarios and more than 50 NLP tasks, integrating diverse constraints within the LLM outputs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Academic Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation
- Question Answering
- Constraint Following

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from real-world scenarios and online instruction data.

**Size**: 1,000 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Constraint Satisfaction Rate (CSR)
- Instruction Satisfaction Rate (ISR)
- Requirement Priority Satisfaction Rate (PSR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on satisfaction of constraints and requirements as per defined scoring rules.

**Interpretation**: High scores in CSR, ISR, and PSR indicate better compliance with user constraints and satisfaction levels.

**Baseline Results**: Detailed performance results from evaluated models such as GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

**Validation**: Validation through expert assessment and cross-validation among annotators.
