# BioMol-MQA: A Multi-Modal Question Answering Dataset For LLM Reasoning Over Bio-Molecular Interactions

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BioMol-MQA: A Multi-Modal Question Answering Dataset For LLM Reasoning Over Bio-Molecular Interactions

**Overview**: BioMol-MQA is a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, composed of a multimodal knowledge graph with text and molecular structure for information retrieval and challenging questions designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over multimodal data.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate models for handling complex, real-world medical queries involving multi-modal reasoning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The dataset is limited to drugs that have both text and SMILES representation; otherwise, relevant proteins only have text, creating potential imbalances.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A multimodal knowledge graph with drug-drug and drug-protein interactions along with text and SMILES for each drug.

**Size**: 1,686 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually generated questions integrated with multimodal data.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Lexical EM
- Lexical F1
- BERTScore F1

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated by comparing generated model outputs to ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better model performance in answering questions accurately.

**Baseline Results**: Results on existing LLMs that show improvement with multimodal context.

**Validation**: Dataset validated through human evaluators and LLM performance metrics.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Safety
