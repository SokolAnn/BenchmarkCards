# Multimodal Academic Cover benchmark (MAC)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Multimodal Academic Cover benchmark (MAC)

**Overview**: MAC is a live benchmark that dynamically evolves alongside scientific advancements to evaluate multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) scientific understanding capabilities, leveraging over 25,000 image-text pairs from leading scientific journals.

**Data Type**: image-text pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMMU

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the MAC benchmark is to continuously assess MLLMs' ability to comprehend implicit scientific concepts in cover images and associated stories.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Image2Text
- Text2Image

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Sourced from the official websites of leading scientific journals including Nature, Science, and Cell.

**Size**: 25,000 image-text pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Curated through live curation mechanisms by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
