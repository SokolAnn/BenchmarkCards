# Codec-SUPERB

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Codec-SUPERB

**Overview**: The Codec-SUPERB challenge is designed to facilitate fair and lightweight comparisons among existing neural audio codec models, providing a platform to analyze the quality of audio resynthesized from various codec models using representative speech applications and objective metrics.

**Data Type**: audio

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a lightweight and efficient benchmark for evaluating neural audio codecs on various speech applications and objective metrics.

**Target Audience**:
- Codec Developers
- Speech Processing Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Automatic Speaker Verification
- Emotion Recognition
- Audio Event Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from license-free datasets like Librispeech, VoxCeleb1, and others for evaluating codec performance.

**Size**: Varies with a random sample for evaluations.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Training-free evaluation
- Objective metrics

**Metrics**:
- Word Error Rate (WER)
- Equal Error Rate (EER)
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on resynthesized audio and compared to reference values.

**Interpretation**: Lower WER and EER indicate better performance in preserving audio quality.

**Baseline Results**: Compared various codec models, including a pioneering model, Encodec.

**Validation**: Evaluation pipeline is training-free and designed to yield quick preliminary results.
