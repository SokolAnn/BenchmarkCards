# TeleQnA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TeleQnA

**Overview**: TeleQnA is the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) in telecommunications, consisting of 10,000 questions and answers drawn from diverse sources including standards and research articles.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Telecommunications

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/netop-team/TeleQnA)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a specialized benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' telecom knowledge and to highlight the need for a specialized telecom foundation model.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The dataset generation process is inherently subjective, as it relies on human judgment to evaluate the correctness of questions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Comprehensive collection from open-access telecom standards, research articles, and technical documentation.

**Size**: 10,000 questions
