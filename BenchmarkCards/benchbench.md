# BenchBench

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: BenchBench

**Overview**: BenchBench is a meta-benchmark designed to evaluate benchmarks against their peers through Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT). It addresses inconsistencies in benchmarking methodologies and provides a standardized procedure for testing the validity of new benchmarks by comparing them to established ones.

**Data Type**: N/A

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To standardize the practice of Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT) and facilitate reliable evaluation of benchmarks in the field of language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Benchmark Creators
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Benchmark Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Various existing benchmarks used for validation in Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT).

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT)
- Statistical agreement metrics

**Metrics**:
- Kendall-tau correlation
- Pearson correlation

**Calculation**: Agreement is calculated by comparing performance scores of models across different benchmarks using correlation metrics like Kendall-tau for ranks and Pearson for scores.

**Interpretation**: High agreement indicates that a benchmark measures similar abilities as established benchmarks, while low agreement suggests a unique trait measured by the benchmark.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Implemented set of best practices for BAT to improve validation consistency.
