# VLAS (Vision-Language-Action Model with Speech Instructions for Customized Robot Manipulation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VLAS (Vision-Language-Action Model with Speech Instructions for Customized Robot Manipulation)

**Overview**: This paper presents VLAS, a novel end-to-end Vision-Language-Action model that integrates speech recognition directly into the robot policy model, allowing robots to understand spoken commands and perform manipulation tasks. Additionally, two datasets, SQA (Speech Question Answering) and CSI (CALVIN with Speech Instructions), are introduced to support the training and evaluation of VLAS.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs, audio-speech instruction pairs
