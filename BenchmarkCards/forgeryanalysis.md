# ForgeryAnalysis

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ForgeryAnalysis

**Overview**: The ForgeryAnalysis dataset is specifically designed to support the supervised fine-tuning and evaluation of multimodal large language models (M-LLMs) in the task of image manipulation detection. It contains detailed clues and analyses generated by an advanced M-LLM and reviewed by experts.

**Data Type**: image and analysis text pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sunzhihao18/ForgerySleuth)
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19466)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a robust dataset for enhancing multimodal large language models' (M-LLMs) capabilities in image manipulation detection through detailed clue analysis and reasoning.

**Target Audience**:
- Image Forensics Researchers
- AI/ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Image Manipulation Detection
- Analysis and Reasoning Generation

**Limitations**: The dataset may not cover all types of manipulations and may not be representative of all real-world scenarios.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed using existing manipulation detection datasets (like MIML, CASIA2, DEFACTO, AutoSplice) and through analyses generated by GPT-4o, reviewed by experts.

**Size**: 50,000 images (ForgeryAnalysis-PT) and 2,370 samples (ForgeryAnalysis-SFT)

**Format**: JSON and Image files

**Annotation**: Initial analyses generated by GPT-4o; reviewed and refined by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Pixel-level Accuracy

**Calculation**: Evaluation is based on the accuracy of detecting manipulations and the quality of text reasoning and explanation generated for the detected manipulations.

**Interpretation**: A higher F1 score indicates better performance in accurately localizing tampered regions in images.

**Baseline Results**: Existing state-of-the-art methods in image manipulation detection for comparison.

**Validation**: Results validated against multiple datasets, ensuring robustness and generalization of the model.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
