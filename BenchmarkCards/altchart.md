## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a rich dataset for chart summarization tasks that enhances accessibility for blind and visually impaired individuals.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Accessibility Researchers
- Data Visualization Developers

**Tasks**:
- Chart Summarization

**Limitations**: Despite having diverse chart categories, the model still tends to hallucinate and produce factually incorrect statements, particularly with complex charts.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from HCI publications across five ACM conferences (CHI, ASSETS, DIS, UIST, W4A) from 2015 to 2023.

**Size**: 10,000 images

**Format**: JPEG

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts for semantically rich descriptions.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the semantic similarity and informativeness of generated summaries compared to human-authored summaries.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in generating accurate and comprehensive chart summaries.

**Validation**: The dataset was validated by rigorous manual checks on a subset of the images to ensure adherence to accessibility guidelines.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Robustness**: Hallucination

**Demographic Analysis**: The dataset aims to improve accessibility for blind and visually impaired individuals, fostering inclusive data representation.
