# LLMTrace

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLMTrace

**Overview**: LLMTrace is a large-scale, bilingual corpus designed to support two key tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level annotations.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Russian

**Similar Benchmarks**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To facilitate a new wave of research into more nuanced, practical, and robust AI detection models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Binary Classification
- Interval Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed using a diverse range of modern proprietary and open-source LLMs.

**Size**: 589,086 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Character-level annotations marking all AI-generated spans within mixed texts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Mean Accuracy
- Mean Average Precision (mAP)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the evaluation of models against train, validation, and test subsets.

**Interpretation**: Metrics indicate the model's performance in classifying text as human or AI-generated, as well as correctly identifying intervals of AI-generated content.

**Baseline Results**: F1 scores for the classification tasks are reported as follows: English-only model F1: 98.64%, Russian-only model F1: 98.62%. Detection task mAP@0.5 for English-only is 0.8749 and for Russian-only is 0.8928.

**Validation**: Validated through domain and length balanced sampling strategies.
