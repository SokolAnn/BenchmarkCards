# Mobilizing Waldo: Evaluating Multimodal AI for Public Mobilization

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Mobilizing Waldo: Evaluating Multimodal AI for Public Mobilization

**Overview**: This paper describes a novel methodology that utilizes 'Where‚Äôs Waldo?' images as proxies for evaluating multimodal large language models (LLMs) in public mobilization contexts. It assesses the abilities of models like GPT-4o to analyze visual information, understand social dynamics, and propose engagement strategies.

**Data Type**: image

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/user/repo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create and validate a methodological framework for testing multimodal LLMs in the context of social mobilization without infringing individual privacy.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Ethics Scholars
- Policymakers

**Tasks**:
- Image Analysis
- Social Dynamics Modeling

**Limitations**: While the methodology allows for controlled assessment, findings may not extrapolate directly to real-world scenarios involving human participants.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Hey-Waldo dataset, a collection of 'Where‚Äôs Waldo?' images.

**Size**: 18 images

**Format**: JPEG

**Annotation**: Hand-labeled to identify Waldo and other characters.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Qualitative evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Spatial accuracy
- Creativity of engagement strategies

**Calculation**: Performance is rated based on defined criteria of accuracy and creativity.

**Interpretation**: Good responses are accurate and precise; Fair responses contain minor inaccuracies; Poor responses show significant errors.

**Baseline Results**: The model's performance was compared to established standards in segmentation and classification.

**Validation**: Validation included overlaying reported coordinates onto the original images for accuracy assessment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Privacy
- Fairness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Privacy**: Personal information in prompt
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: The methodology avoids analysis of real individuals, eliminating privacy issues.
