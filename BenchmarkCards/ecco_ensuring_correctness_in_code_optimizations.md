# ECCO (Ensuring Correctness in Code Optimizations)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ECCO (Ensuring Correctness in Code Optimizations)

**Overview**: ECCO is a reproducible benchmark for evaluating program efficiency via two paradigms: natural language-based code generation and history-based code editing. It supports evaluations in terms of execution correctness, runtime efficiency, and memory efficiency.

**Data Type**: Python code pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Python

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CodeEff/ECCO)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a solid testbed for program optimization and facilitate research in LLM-based generation of efficient code.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Code Optimization
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from the IBM CodeNet dataset containing competitive programming problems.

**Size**: 50,000 Python solution pairs across 1,380 competitive programming problems

**Format**: Pairs of Python code solutions

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
