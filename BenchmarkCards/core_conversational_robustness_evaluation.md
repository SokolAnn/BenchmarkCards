# CORE (Conversational Robustness Evaluation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CORE (Conversational Robustness Evaluation)

**Overview**: CORE is a metric to quantify the effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different game-theoretic interactions, integrating measures of cluster entropy, lexical repetition, and semantic similarity to evaluate dialog quality.

**Data Type**: dialog interactions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/psyonp/core)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation of linguistic diversity and quality in multi-agent conversations driven by game-theoretic incentives.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Dialog Evaluation

**Limitations**: Limited to dyadic interactions and short-term dialogs, may not capture the full complexity of emergent communication in larger or longer-term agent collectives.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Simulated dialogs between pairs of LLM agents under competitive, cooperative, and neutral conditions.

**Size**: 5,760 interactions

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by interacting agents

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- CORE Score
- Zipf's Law parameters
- Heap's Law parameters

**Calculation**: CORE is calculated based on normalized mode entropy, repetition penalty, and semantic stagnation penalty from dialog data.

**Interpretation**: Higher CORE values indicate more lexically diverse and high-quality interactions within dialogs.

**Validation**: Statistical significance testing using Mann-Whitney U tests for comparing interaction modes.
