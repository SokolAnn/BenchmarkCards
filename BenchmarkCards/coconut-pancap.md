**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: COCO images with advanced COCONut panoptic masks

**Size**: 143,000 image-text pairs (118,000 for training, 25,000 for validation)

**Format**: JPEG

**Annotation**: Human-edited, densely annotated descriptions with segmentation masks

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
