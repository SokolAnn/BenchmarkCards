# Reefknot: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Relation Hallucination Evaluation, Analysis and Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Reefknot: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Relation Hallucination Evaluation, Analysis and Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models

**Overview**: Reefknot is a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations in multimodal large language models, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples with two types of relationships and three evaluation tasks to assess relation hallucinations comprehensively.

**Data Type**: relation-based question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- POPE
- MMRel
- R-bench

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and mitigate relation hallucinations in multimodal large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Yes/No Question Answering
- Multiple Choice Question Answering
- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Visual Genome scene graph dataset

**Size**: 21,880 questions across 11,084 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Expert-based validation

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Hallucination rate
- Rscore

**Calculation**: Rscore is calculated as the average of (1 minus hallucination rate) across three tasks.

**Interpretation**: Lower hallucination rates indicate better performance.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Multi-turn manual verification by domain experts.
