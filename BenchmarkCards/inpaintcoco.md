# InpaintCOCO

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: InpaintCOCO

**Overview**: InpaintCOCO is a new challenging dataset for assessing the fine-grained alignment of colors, objects, and sizes in vision-language models, created using generative inpainting from COCO images by altering visual concepts.

**Data Type**: image-text pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:

- VL-CheckList
- SVO

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enhance fine-grained concept understanding in vision-language models through a new dataset and a novel pretraining method with synthetic hard negative samples.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Text-to-Image Retrieval

**Limitations**: The dataset only includes minor changes to visual components, which may not generalize well outside the Western context.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generative inpainting from COCO images, creating adversarial examples to evaluate models

**Size**: 1,260 images

**Format**: Inpainted images with textual descriptions

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by student workers with specific guidelines for generating hard negatives

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Recall@5

**Calculation**: Model performance is calculated based on ranking evaluation for fine-grained understanding and retrieval capabilities.

**Interpretation**: Accuracy measures how well specific visual concepts are learned, while Recall@5 indicates general retrieval performance.

**Baseline Results**: Original OpenAI CLIP model, classical pre-trained CLIP model, models trained with 1, 2, or 3 hard negatives per batch.

**Validation**: Extensive evaluations across various vision-language datasets to verify robustness and performance.
