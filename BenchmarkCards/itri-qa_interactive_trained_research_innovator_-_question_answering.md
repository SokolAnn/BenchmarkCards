## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: iTRI-QA (Interactive Trained Research Innovator - Question Answering)

**Overview**: A tool for the development of a customized question-answer (QA) dataset tailored for the needs of researchers leveraging language models (LMs) to retrieve scientific knowledge in a QA format.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Liu-Qiming/iTRI-QA/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To streamline the process of creating customized QA databases for research-oriented applications using LMs.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Domain Experts
- Academics

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The computational resources required for fine-tuning and deploying even medium-sized LLMs can be prohibitive.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: PubMed and customized QA examples generated through domain expert input.

**Size**: 50 examples

**Format**: JSONL

**Annotation**: Manual curation by domain experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
