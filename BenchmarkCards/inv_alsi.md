## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a benchmark for assessing large language models using the INV ALSI framework.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Education Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from public sources including the Gestinv database which contains tests from the Italian national evaluations.

**Size**: 2114 questions and 2808 unique items across multiple tests
