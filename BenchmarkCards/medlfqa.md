# MedLFQA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MedLFQA

**Overview**: MedLFQA is a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain, facilitating automatic evaluation of factuality for LLM responses.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dmis-lab/MedLFQA)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dmis-lab/OLAPH)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain and improve their factuality.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals

**Tasks**:
- Long-form Question Answering

**Limitations**: The dataset consists only of test datasets, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of the O LAPH framework on training datasets.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Reconstructed from current biomedical LFQA datasets including LiveQA, MedicationQA, HealthSearchQA, and K-QA.

**Size**: 4,000 QA pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Curated by medical experts with additional statements evaluated through automated methods.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
