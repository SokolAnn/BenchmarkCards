# LLM4VV (Large Language Models for Verification and Validation)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLM4VV (Large Language Models for Verification and Validation)

**Overview**: This paper proposes a dual-LLM system for the generation and validation of compiler tests for directive-based parallel programming models, evaluating the capabilities of various LLMs in generating and judging code.

**Data Type**: compiler test cases

**Domains**:
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21447)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop an autonomous compiler test creation system using LLMs for directive-based parallel programming models.

**Target Audience**:
- Software Engineers
- Researchers
- Compiler Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Code Validation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Existing hand-written OpenMP and OpenACC Validation and Verification Suites.

**Size**: Several thousand directive-clause combinations

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual verification and introduction of errors for test cases.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
