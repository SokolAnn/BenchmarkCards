## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of FACTBENCH is to provide a dynamic benchmark for evaluating the factuality of language models in real-world scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Factuality Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Developed from a dataset of language model interactions (LMSYS-Chat-1M) featuring prompts that elicit hallucinations in language models.

**Size**: 1,000 prompts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human-annotated factuality labels on 4,467 content units.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Factual precision
- Hallucination score

**Calculation**: The factual precision is calculated as the proportion of supported units among all extracted units across responses.

**Interpretation**: Higher factual precision indicates better performance in generating factual outputs.

**Baseline Results**: Various LM models evaluated against FACTBENCH, including GPT4-o, Gemini1.5-Pro, and two Llama models.

**Validation**: Prompts categorized into three tiers (Hard, Moderate, Easy) based on their challenge level.
