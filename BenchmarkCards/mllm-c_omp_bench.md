## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the comparative reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across various dimensions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Comparative Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from diverse vision datasets through visually oriented questions covering eight dimensions of relativity, including comparative reasoning tasks between image pairs.

**Size**: 39,800 triplets

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by human annotators for accuracy and relevance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated by comparing model predictions with ground-truth answers for each question in the benchmark.

**Interpretation**: A question is answered correctly if the model's prediction exactly matches the ground-truth answer.

**Baseline Results**: GPT-4V reached an accuracy of 74.7% on the benchmark test split.

**Validation**: Cross-verification by multiple annotators to ensure quality and consistency.
