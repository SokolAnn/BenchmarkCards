# C-FAITH (Chinese Fine-Grained Benchmark for Automated Hallucination Evaluation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: C-FAITH (Chinese Fine-Grained Benchmark for Automated Hallucination Evaluation)

**Overview**: C-FAITH is designed to systematically assess the hallucination generated by large language models with fine-grained error categories. It is constructed using HaluAgent, an automated framework that generates a QA dataset from knowledge documents.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pkulcwmzx/C-FAITH)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a scalable resource for evaluating hallucinations in LLMs in the Chinese language.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 1,399 Chinese knowledge documents collected from multiple domains including Wikipedia-CN, Baidu Baike, and Sougou Baike.

**Size**: 60,702 entries

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: The dataset is automatically generated and verified for correctness using predefined rules.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Hallucination rate

**Calculation**: The hallucination rate is calculated based on the comparison of LLM outputs with correct responses and verified against known knowledge.

**Interpretation**: Lower hallucination rates indicate better performance in accurately reflecting factual information.

**Validation**: Data generated and validated through multiple prompts and checks for correctness and hallucination types.
