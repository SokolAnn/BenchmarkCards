# Leader360V (A Large-scale, Real-world 360 Video Dataset for Multi-task Learning in Diverse Environments)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Leader360V (A Large-scale, Real-world 360 Video Dataset for Multi-task Learning in Diverse Environments)

**Overview**: Leader360V is the first large-scale (10K+), labeled real-world 360 video dataset specifically designed for instance segmentation and tracking in diverse environments. It integrates existing public datasets with self-collected 360 videos to facilitate automated annotation through A3360V, a three-phase pipeline, thereby enhancing model performance in 360 video understanding.

**Data Type**: video

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- N/A

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- 360VOS
- PanoVOS
- 360VOT

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive and scalable dataset for multi-task learning in 360 video understanding, focusing on instance segmentation and tracking.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Instance Segmentation
- Object Tracking

**Limitations**: Our current Leader360V dataset does not yet cover all object classes commonly encountered in daily life, nor does it include annotations for the motion states of moving objects.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Integral combination of existing public datasets and self-collected 360 videos in diverse environments.

**Size**: 10,000+ videos

**Format**: 360 Video

**Annotation**: Automated through the A3360V pipeline, involving LLMs for semantic labeling and human oversight for final revisions.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated Annotation Pipelines
