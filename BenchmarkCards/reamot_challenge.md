## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To advance research in reasoning-based multi-object tracking and evaluate models' reasoning capabilities.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Multi-Object Tracking

**Limitations**: The analysis of the ReaMOT Challenge dataset is not sufficiently comprehensive.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from 12 datasets including Argoverse-HD, DanceTrack, GMOT-40, KITTI, MOT17, MOT20, MPHOI, PathTrack, PoseTrack, SportsMOT, UA-DETRAC, and UAVDT.

**Size**: 423,359 image-language pairs, 1,156 language instructions, 869 scenes.

**Format**: video

**Annotation**: Manual annotation combined with GPT-assisted annotation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation using new tailored metrics for the ReaMOT task.

**Metrics**:
- RIDF1
- RMOTA
- RRcll
- RPrcn

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated using a combination of language instructions' reasoning scores.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in reasoning-based multi-object tracking.

**Baseline Results**: ReaTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the ReaTrack framework.
