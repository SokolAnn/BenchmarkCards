# M-QALM

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: M-QALM

**Overview**: M-QALM is a comprehensive collection of clinical datasets comprising 16 multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) and 6 abstractive question answering (AQA) datasets designed to assess recall and comprehension of medical knowledge in large language models (LLMs).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMLU
- MEDMCQA
- USMLE

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating the medical knowledge recall and comprehension capabilities of large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Multiple Choice Question Answering
- Abstractive Question Answering

**Limitations**: While the benchmark evaluates the capability of LLMs in answering medical questions, it doesn't assess their potential application in real-world scenarios.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Combination of various medical examination datasets and question-answering tasks gathered from literature.

**Size**: 197,420 question-answering pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated by domain experts where applicable.
