## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor learning and provide a unified benchmark for evaluating backdoor defenses in multimodal contexts.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Backdoor Detection
- Classification

**Limitations**: It currently supports a limited number of datasets and models, and does not yet support all multimodal applications.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Eleven commonly used datasets including CIFAR10, SST-2, SpeechCommands among others.

**Size**: 110,000 images, 630,000 text instances, 105,829 audio samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually labeled or sourced datasets.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- Detection Accuracy (DAC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the performance of attacks and defenses against the benchmark datasets.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better model performance, while lower ASR indicates more effective defense mechanisms.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluated through experiments on different datasets and performance metrics.
