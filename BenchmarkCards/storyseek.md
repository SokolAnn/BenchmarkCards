# StorySeek

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: StorySeek

**Overview**: StorySeek is a semi-automatic dataset containing over 1,000 user stories with corresponding goals and project context, constructed to evaluate goal-driven requirements elicitation.

**Data Type**: user stories

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoftACE/StorySeek)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SoftACE-Lab/goal2story)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To support research and industry applications in requirements engineering, aiding in the identification and generation of user stories based on project goals.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Requirements Elicitation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from real-world Agile projects hosted on GitLab, utilizing the NEODATASET collection.

**Size**: 1,005 records

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Semi-automatic dataset construction with validation using LLMs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Agent-based validation

**Metrics**:
- Factuality Hit Rate (FHR)
- Quality And Consistency Evaluation (QuACE)

**Calculation**: FHR measures the ratio of generated user stories that align with real project data, while QuACE evaluates the quality and goal alignment of the stories.

**Interpretation**: Higher FHR indicates better alignment with requirements, and higher QuACE scores signify better quality and relevance to goals.

**Baseline Results**: Comparative results showed Goal2Story outperforming Super-Agent using standard metrics.

**Validation**: Validation done through automated assessments and human evaluation.
