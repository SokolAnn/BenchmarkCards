# FollowBench (Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FollowBench (Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark)

**Overview**: FollowBench is a benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating five different types of fine-grained constraints. It employs a novel multi-level mechanism that adds constraints incrementally to evaluate models on various difficulties.

- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation
- Open-ended Question Answering
- Content Constraints Evaluation
- Situation Constraints Evaluation

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated dataset with instructions based on various NLP tasks.

**Size**: 820 instructions

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: Manual and automated verification by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Hard Satisfaction Rate (HSR)
- Soft Satisfaction Rate (SSR)
- Consistent Satisfaction Levels (CSL)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the proportion of constraints satisfied in the instructions evaluated.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better adherence to constraints by LLMs.

**Validation**: Dual-layer human verification on instructions.
