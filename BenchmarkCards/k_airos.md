# K AIROS

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: K AIROS

**Overview**: K AIROS is a benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, allowing for systematic investigation of how trust, peer action, and self-confidence influence decisions in LLMs during social interactions.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice question answering

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Social Computing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate and improve how LLMs perform in socially interactive, trust-sensitive environments.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Social Interaction Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Diverse datasets including Reasoning, Knowledge, Common Sense, and Creativity tasks combined into a multiple-choice format.

**Size**: 10,000 training instances, 3,000 testing instances

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Crowdsourced and manually verified

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Utility
