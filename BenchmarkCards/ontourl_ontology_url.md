# ONTOURL (Ontology URL)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ONTOURL (Ontology URL)

**Overview**: ONTOURL is the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs‚Äô capabilities in handling ontologies‚Äîformal and symbolic representations of domain knowledge. It assesses understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Science
- Finance
- Healthcare
- Legal
- Education
- Environmental Science
- Media and Entertainment

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the capabilities of large language models in understanding, reasoning, and learning with structured symbolic knowledge through ontologies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Ontology Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Understanding
- Reasoning
- Learning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Extracted from 40 expert-created, open-source ontologies spanning various domains.

**Size**: 57,303 questions

**Format**: Multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions

**Annotation**: Generated using a systematic pipeline involving entity extraction and expert verification for quality assurance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
