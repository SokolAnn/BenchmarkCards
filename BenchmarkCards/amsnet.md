# AMSNet

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AMSNet

**Overview**: AMSNet is a dataset designed to facilitate the exploration of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) applications in Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit generation by providing a comprehensive dataset delineating the schematic-netlist relationship.

**Data Type**: transistor-level schematics and SPICE format netlists

**Domains**:
- Electrical Engineering

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://ams-net.github.io/)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of AMSNet is to support automatic design generation of AMS circuits by providing a comprehensive dataset of schematics and their corresponding netlists.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Circuit Designers
- EDA Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Circuit Generation
- Netlist Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Transistor-level schematics and corresponding SPICE format netlists created through an automatic technique for converting schematics into netlists

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: SPICE

**Annotation**: The data was collected through a combination of manual labeling and automatic detection processes.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Component detection
- Net detection

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy of component detection was measured by the proportion of correctly identified components against the total components labeled.

**Interpretation**: Accuracy is interpreted as the proportion of correct detections in both the component and netlist generation process.

**Baseline Results**: Component detection accuracy of 97.1% and net labeling accuracy of 96.7% were achieved during the dataset creation

**Validation**: The methodology has been tested by manually evaluating the accuracy of the trained models on labeled data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
