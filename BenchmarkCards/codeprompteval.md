# CodePromptEval

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CodePromptEval

**Overview**: CodePromptEval is a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate the impact of five prompt techniques on correctness, similarity, and code quality of functions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes a comprehensive factorial experiment designed to assess these prompt techniques and their interactions.

**Data Type**: code generation prompts

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering

**Languages**:
- Python

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CoderEval

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/icetlab/CodePromptEval)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the impact of different prompt techniques on code generation by LLMs, focusing on dimensions of correctness, similarity to human-written code, and code quality.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- AI Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: The impact of prompt techniques was not as large as expected; most combinations of techniques do not lead to significant improvements.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A combination of prompts from the CoderEval benchmark and extended with variations for prompt techniques.

**Size**: 7072 prompts

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Manually created by researchers based on functionality requirements.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Statistical analysis
- Multilinear regression

**Metrics**:
- Pass@1
- CrystalBLEU

**Calculation**: Pass@1 measures how many of the generated functions pass the provided tests; CrystalBLEU measures similarity to human-written code.

**Interpretation**: Higher Pass@1 indicates better correctness; higher CrystalBLEU indicates closer similarity to human-generated code.

**Baseline Results**: Performance differences of LLMs in passing tests and generating similar code as measured by Pass@1 and CrystalBLEU scores.

**Validation**: Statistical tests were performed to validate the performance of generated functions.
