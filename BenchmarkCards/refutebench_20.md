# RefuteBench 2.0

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: RefuteBench 2.0

**Overview**: RefuteBench 2.0 is a refutation evaluation benchmark that extends the original RefuteBench by incorporating LLM agents as refuters and evaluators, allowing for flexible and comprehensive assessment of a large language model's ability to incorporate user refutation feedback.

**Data Type**: text

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate an LLM's ability to incorporate user refutation feedback through transient and persistent refutation scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Open-ended Writing

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data is collected from various benchmark datasets including WMT 2023 English-to-Chinese test set, XSum, and human-written texts for article writing tasks.

**Size**: 100 seeds for each task

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human evaluations of model responses and refutations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Dynamic evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Pearson Correlation

**Calculation**: Scores were calculated based on human evaluations of model responses to refutations.

**Interpretation**: Scores indicate how well the model's responses align with user refutation feedback.

**Baseline Results**: Performance is benchmarked against earlier versions of RefuteBench.

**Validation**: Human evaluators conducted meta-evaluation comparing model-generated responses with human scores.
