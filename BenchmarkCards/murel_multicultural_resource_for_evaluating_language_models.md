# MUREL (MUlticultural Resource for Evaluating Language Models)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: MUREL (MUlticultural Resource for Evaluating Language Models)

**Overview**: MUREL is a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens spanning six different cultures, developed to facilitate experiments on cultural neuron identification and manipulation in multilingual large language models (LLMs).

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- German
- Danish
- Chinese
- Russian
- Persian

**Resources**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To understand and manipulate cultural neurons in multilingual language models for promoting fairness, inclusivity, and alignment.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Cultural Analysis
- Model Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Compiled from public sources, covering various cultural dimensions as outlined by Liu et al. (2025).

**Size**: 85.2 million tokens

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Neuron localization
- Neuron ablation experiments

**Metrics**:
- Perplexity

**Calculation**: Perplexity changes measured after neuron ablation to assess the impact of cultural and language-specific neurons.

**Interpretation**: Higher perplexity indicates a greater impact of neuron intervention on model performance.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: N/A

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Fairness

**Atlas Risks**:
No specific atlas risks defined

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: Potential misuse could reinforce cultural stereotypes if interventions are misapplied.
