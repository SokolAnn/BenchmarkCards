# V ACT (Video Automatic Causal Testing)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: V ACT (Video Automatic Causal Testing)

**Overview**: V ACT is an automated framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of video generation models (VGMs) in real-world scenarios. It combines causal analysis techniques with language model assistance to assess model behaviors without human intervention.

**Data Type**: causal testing scenarios and video data

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to systematically evaluate the causal learning capabilities of video generation models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Causal Reasoning Evaluation
- Video Generation Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 60 causal systems generated through automatic means, validated through crowd experiments.

**Size**: 60 causal systems

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated using a language model and validated through crowd-sourced human annotations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automatic evaluation using language models
- Intervention experiments for causal testing

**Metrics**:
- Text Consistency
