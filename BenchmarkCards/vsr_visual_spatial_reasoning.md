# VSR (Visual Spatial Reasoning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VSR (Visual Spatial Reasoning)

**Overview**: The benchmark evaluates the capabilities of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) in recognizing visual positional information and following instructions related to spatial reasoning. It addresses issues of inconsistent performance and answer bias in existing models by proposing a unified instruction test set and expanding existing datasets.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs
