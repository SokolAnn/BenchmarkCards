# naab

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: naab

**Overview**: naab is a publicly available, cleaned, ready-to-use Farsi textual corpus introduced to improve NLP for the Farsi language. The project provides two releases: naab (cleaned) and naab-raw (unprocessed), and includes a streaming-based pre-processing toolkit. The corpus comprises roughly 130GB of data (billions of words and hundreds of millions of paragraphs) and is hosted on Hugging Face for easy access.

**Data Type**: text (paragraphs / sequences)

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Processing

**Languages**:
- Farsi

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Persian NLP
- OSCAR-fa
- AGP
- LSCP (Large Scale Colloquial Persian Language Understanding)
- Telegram corpus
- Persian Wikipedia
- Miras Text
- Common Crawl - fa
- Leipzig Corpora
- VOA corpus
- Persian poems corpus
- Tehran English-Persian parallel corpus (TEP)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Provide the largest publicly available, cleaned, ready-to-use Farsi textual corpus (naab) and an unprocessed version (naab-raw), along with a streaming-based pre-processing toolkit to facilitate Farsi NLP research and model training.

**Target Audience**:
- NLP Researchers
- Researchers and practitioners focusing on low-resource languages
- Model developers

**Tasks**:
- Language Modeling
- Pre-training / Fine-tuning Language Models
- Text Classification
- Named Entity Recognition
- Part-of-Speech Tagging
- Text Summarization
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Text-to-Speech

**Limitations**: Stopwords were retained (not removed) to preserve contextual integrity; deduplication was not performed (possible duplicated content); potential presence of personal information despite filtering; slight possibility of corrupted sentences introduced by character filtering.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Combined cleaned corpora including Persian NLP (aggregating Common Crawl - fa, MirasText, Web to Corpus, Persian Wikipedia, Leipzig Corpora, VOA corpus, Persian poems corpus, Tehran English-Persian Parallel Corpus), OSCAR-fa, AGP (from ASR Gooyesh Pardaz), LSCP (Farsi portion), and a curated Telegram corpus.

**Size**: Approximately 130GB total. Table 1 reports 129.2GB total consisting of 236,976,777 paragraphs and 14,957,936,489 words. The paper also states training: 126GB (>224 million sequences, ~15 billion words) and test: 2.3GB (~11 million sequences, ~300 million words).

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Streaming pre-processing pipeline for cleaning (chunk-based, O(1) memory in streaming fashion)
- Word frequency analysis (word counts and stopword-filtered counts) for corpus analysis

**Calculation**: N/A

**Interpretation**: N/A

**Validation**: Random spot-checking of texts for corrupted sentences was performed and no instances were found in the checked samples. No deduplication was performed; no formal benchmarking validation reported beyond the described analyses.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Privacy
- Accuracy
- Misuse

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Privacy**: Personal information in data
- **Accuracy**: Data contamination, Poor model accuracy
- **Misuse**: Improper usage

**Potential Harm**: ['Potential presence of personal information in the dataset']
