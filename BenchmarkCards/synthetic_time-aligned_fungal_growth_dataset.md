## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the Synthetic Time-Aligned Fungal Growth Dataset is to provide a basis for modeling biological progression and temporal dynamics in fungal growth.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Biological Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Classification
- Regression

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic dataset generated for assessing fungal growth stages and timestamps.

**Size**: Not explicitly stated

**Format**: Not explicitly stated

**Annotation**: Images are accompanied by categorical labels and timestamps for each growth stage.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Multi-task learning
- Transformer-based regression

**Metrics**:
- Classification Accuracy
- Temporal Accuracy
- Mean Squared Error

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated using standard approaches for cross-entropy loss for classification and MSE for regression.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates effective classification of fungal stages, while lower MSE indicates better timestamp prediction.

**Baseline Results**: Not explicitly stated

**Validation**: Model evaluation is conducted against the synthetic dataset across multiple training epochs to assess performance.
