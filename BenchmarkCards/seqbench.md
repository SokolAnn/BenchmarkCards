## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To probe and analyze sequential reasoning capabilities in language models by systematically controlling key complexity factors.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Sequential Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated from a controlled algorithmic pathfinding process.

**Size**: 7,079 instances

**Format**: Various structured task configurations in natural language.

**Annotation**: Automatically annotated with logical depth, backtracking count, and noise ratio.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Pass@1 Success Rate
- Progress Ratio
- Precision
- Recall

**Calculation**: Success Rate measures the proportion of runs with correct action sequences, Progress Ratio is k/n where n is total actions and k is correctly executed actions.

**Interpretation**: Pass@1 Success Rate indicates exact matches to ground truth, and Progress Ratio assesses how far models progress before errors occur.

**Validation**: 5 independent runs per problem to establish robust performance statistics.
