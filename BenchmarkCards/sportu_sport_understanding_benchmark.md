## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the sports understanding capabilities of MLLMs across text and video-based tasks, focusing on deep reasoning and rule-based understanding in sports.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The models showed significant challenges in handling complex reasoning and rule comprehension, particularly in tasks requiring deep sports knowledge.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: SPORTU-text and SPORTU-video datasets generated and annotated by sports experts.

**Size**: 900 multiple-choice questions, 1,701 slow-motion video clips, 12,048 QA pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human-annotated explanations by sports experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
