# SafetyDetect

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: SafetyDetect

**Overview**: SafetyDetect is a dataset designed for enabling embodied agents to detect unsafe and unsanitary situations in home environments, consisting of 1000 anomalous home scenes.

**Data Type**: scenes with unsafe or unsanitary conditions

**Domains**:
- Robotics

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the SafetyDetect dataset is to benchmark the ability of embodied AI agents to infer unsafe or unsanitary situations in a household setting.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Robotics Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Anomaly Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Generated using the VirtualHome simulator, with added object models from various sources.

**Size**: 1000 scenes

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Anomaly Success (AS)
- Conditioned Anomaly Success (CAS)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the fraction of detected anomalies and their correctness relative to user context.

**Interpretation**: A higher AS and CAS indicates better performance in detecting unsafe or unsanitary conditions.

**Validation**: Performance evaluated through both simulated scenarios and real-world experiments.
