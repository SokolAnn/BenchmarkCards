# AGNOSTOS

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AGNOSTOS

**Overview**: AGNOSTOS is a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation, comprising 23 unseen manipulation tasks that differ from common training task distributions.

**Data Type**: task-action pairs

**Domains**:
- Robotics

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the limits of vision-language-action (VLA) models in zero-shot generalization for robotic manipulation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Robotics Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Robotic Manipulation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: RLBench simulation environment

**Size**: 3600 demonstrations for 18 seen tasks and 23 unseen tasks for testing

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Data collected from demonstrations of robotic manipulation tasks

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Systems evaluation
- Cross-task zero-shot testing

**Metrics**:
- Success Rate

**Calculation**: Mean and standard deviation of success rates over multiple trials.

**Interpretation**: Higher success rates indicate better generalization of VLA models to unseen tasks.

**Baseline Results**: Comparison against existing VLA models, including performance metrics reported.

**Validation**: Evaluation on 23 unseen manipulation tasks categorized by difficulty.
