- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cindyzhangxy/CaseReportBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a benchmark for evaluating dense information extraction from clinical case reports and to identify effective LLM-based methods for this task.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Information Extraction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: De-identified case reports from the non-commercial PMC Open Access Subset.

**Size**: 138 case reports

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Expert-annotated by clinicians following predefined guidelines.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- Clinical evaluations

**Metrics**:
- Token Set Ratio (TSR)
