## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for the development and evaluation of automated telecom fraud detection models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Scenario Classification
- Fraud Detection
- Fraud Type Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated through real call ASR processing, large language model imitation, and multi-agent adversarial synthesis.

**Size**: 28,511 audio-text pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotations performed through slow-thinking reasoning with models generating structured outputs for various fraud-related tasks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Weighted F1 scores calculated as accuracy metrics across various classification tasks.
