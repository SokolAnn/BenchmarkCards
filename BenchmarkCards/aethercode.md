## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and set a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Competitive Programming Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Algorithmic Problem Solving

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Problems sourced from premier programming competitions worldwide, including the Olympiad in Informatics (OI) and the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).

**Size**: 456 problems

**Format**: Markdown+LaTeX

**Annotation**: Problems annotated by a team of competitive programming experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated test case generation
- Expert curation

**Metrics**:
- True Positive Rate (TPR)
- True Negative Rate (TNR)

**Calculation**: The TPR and TNR are calculated by validating test cases against a large corpus of collected solutions.

**Interpretation**: A high TPR and TNR indicates that the benchmark's test cases effectively discriminate between correct and incorrect solutions.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Validated against a dataset of over 30,000 human submissions.
