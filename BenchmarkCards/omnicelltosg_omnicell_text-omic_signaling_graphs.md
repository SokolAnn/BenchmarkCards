# OmniCellTOSG (OmniCell Text-Omic Signaling Graphs)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OmniCellTOSG (OmniCell Text-Omic Signaling Graphs)

**Overview**: OmniCellTOSG is the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs, representing the signaling graph/system of individual cells with annotations about organ, disease, sex, age, and cell-subtype. It aims to facilitate the development of novel joint LLM and GNN models for decoding complex cell signaling systems.
