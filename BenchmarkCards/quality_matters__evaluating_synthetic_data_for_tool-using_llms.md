# Quality Matters: Evaluating Synthetic Data for Tool-Using LLMs

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Quality Matters: Evaluating Synthetic Data for Tool-Using LLMs

**Overview**: This paper proposes two approaches for assessing the reliability of data for training LLMs to use external tools, including intrinsic quality evaluation criteria and in-context evaluation metrics (ICE). The findings indicate that models trained on high-quality data significantly outperform those trained on unvalidated data, highlighting the importance of data quality in model performance for tool-using LLMs.

**Data Type**: instruction and API call sequences

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the quality of synthetic data for tool-using LLMs and demonstrate its impact on model performance.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Tool Usage Evaluation
- Data Quality Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Datasets synthesized for training tool-using LLMs, specifically ToolBench and ToolAlpaca.

**Size**: 125,000 examples for ToolBench, 4,200 examples for ToolAlpaca

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by researchers according to intrinsic quality criteria.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Intrinsically Evaluated Data Quality
- In-Context Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Pass Rate
- ICE Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the proportion of instances that the model successfully addressed according to the intrinsic evaluation criteria.

**Interpretation**: A higher pass rate and ICE score indicate better data quality and improved model performance.

**Baseline Results**: Models trained on high-quality subsets consistently performed better than those trained on full datasets with low-quality data.

**Validation**: Evaluation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed data quality metrics against human annotations.
