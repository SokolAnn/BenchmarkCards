# GVGAI-LLM

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: GVGAI-LLM

**Overview**: GVGAI-LLM is a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It features a diverse collection of arcade-style games designed to test a model‚Äôs ability to handle tasks that differ from most existing LLM benchmarks.
