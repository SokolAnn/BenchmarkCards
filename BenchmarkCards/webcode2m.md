## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To introduce a large-scale real-world dataset for generating webpage code from webpage designs to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Web pages sourced from the Common Crawl dataset, filtered and processed to collect design images and corresponding HTML/CSS code.

**Size**: 2,563,905 instances

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Data quality ensured by a scoring model trained on a manually annotated subset of 10,000 entries, achieving validation accuracy of 90%.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
