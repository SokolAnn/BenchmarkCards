# StoryTTS: A Highly Expressive Text-to-Speech Dataset with Rich Textual Expressiveness Annotations

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: StoryTTS: A Highly Expressive Text-to-Speech Dataset with Rich Textual Expressiveness Annotations

**Overview**: StoryTTS is a highly expressive TTS dataset with rich expressiveness from both acoustic and textual perspectives. It includes comprehensive annotations for speech-related textual expressiveness, derived from a Mandarin storytelling show.

**Data Type**: speech-text pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://goarsenal.github.io/StoryTTS)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset that enables research on enhancing text-to-speech synthesis through detailed annotations of textual expressiveness.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- TTS Developers
- Linguists

**Tasks**:
- Text-to-Speech Synthesis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Mandarin storytelling show recordings

**Size**: 61 hours of audio

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation and batch annotation using large language models (LLMs) for textual expressiveness.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Mean Opinion Score (MOS)
- Mel-cepstral distortion (MCD)
- Log-F0 Root Mean Square Error (log-F0 RMSE)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated through MOS tests with listeners to assess expressiveness and audio quality.

**Interpretation**: Higher MOS ratings indicate better expressiveness and sound quality.

**Validation**: N/A
