# CogniLoad

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CogniLoad

**Overview**: CogniLoad is a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) designed to systematically evaluate long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by independently controlling key parameters: intrinsic difficulty, distractor density, and task length.

**Data Type**: natural-language logic puzzles
