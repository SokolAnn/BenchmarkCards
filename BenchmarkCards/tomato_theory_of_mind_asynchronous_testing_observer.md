# ToMATO (Theory of Mind Asynchronous Testing Observer)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ToMATO (Theory of Mind Asynchronous Testing Observer)

**Overview**: ToMATO is a new Theory of Mind benchmark formulated as multiple-choice QA over conversations, capturing both first- and second-order mental states in various categories. It addresses limitations in previous benchmarks by incorporating information asymmetry and distinct personality traits.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice question answering

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the Theory of Mind capabilities of LLMs through a comprehensive benchmark that includes diverse personality traits and first- and second-order mental states.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Theory of Mind Evaluation
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: ToMATO's performance may vary depending on the personality traits of characters involved in the conversations.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated through LLM-LLM conversations with Inner Speech prompting.

**Size**: 5,400 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated via LLM-LLM interaction and validated by human raters.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
