# Quantifying AI Psychology: A Psychometrics Benchmark for Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Quantifying AI Psychology: A Psychometrics Benchmark for Large Language Models

**Overview**: This paper presents a comprehensive psychometrics benchmark for LLMs that covers six psychological dimensions: personality, values, emotion, theory of mind, motivation, and intelligence. The benchmark includes thirteen datasets featuring diverse scenarios and item types to assess LLMs' psychological attributes.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Natural Language Processing
- Psychometrics

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to investigate the psychological attributes of large language models (LLMs) through a psychometric framework, providing a comprehensive assessment of their behaviors and abilities.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Psychologists
- AI Developers
- Social Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Psychological Assessment
- Behavior Analysis
- Model Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Three sources: standard psychometrics tests, established datasets, and self-designed scenarios.

**Size**: Thirteen datasets

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation using psychometric tests
- Model-based assessments
- Open-ended response validation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Dual Question Accuracy
- Kappa coefficient

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on averages of scores from item responses and evaluations by LLM raters.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores represent a stronger manifestation of psychological dimensions in LLMs.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Validation processes include internal consistency checks and inter-rater reliability assessments.
