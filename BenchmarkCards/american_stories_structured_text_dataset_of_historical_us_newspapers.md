## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide researchers with a high-quality corpus of structured and transcribed newspaper article texts from historical U.S. newspapers.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Historians
- Social Scientists
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Topic Classification
- Content Analysis
- Language Modeling

**Limitations**: The dataset contains historical language reflecting the cultural biases of the time.

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Training generative models without filtering due to potential toxicity.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Library of Congress‚Äôs Chronicling America project.

**Size**: 1.14 billion content regions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated via a deep learning pipeline with layout detection and OCR techniques.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Layout Detection
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Article Association

**Metrics**:
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Mean Average Precision (mAP)

**Calculation**: Metrics are evaluated based on comparison to ground truth annotations in dedicated validation datasets.

**Interpretation**: A lower CER indicates higher OCR accuracy.

**Baseline Results**: CER of 0.051 (0.044 after spellchecking) and mAP for article bounding boxes at 91.31.

**Validation**: Evaluated using labeled datasets and inter-annotator reliability.
