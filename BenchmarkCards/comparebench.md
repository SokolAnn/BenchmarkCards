**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Quantity Comparison
- Temporal Reasoning
- Geometric Property Comparison
- Spatial Relation Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from TallyBench and HistCaps datasets.

**Size**: 1,000 QA pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is measured as the percentage of exact matches between predicted and ground-truth answers.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in visual comparison reasoning tasks.

**Baseline Results**: Human performance is near 100% on most tasks.

**Validation**: Models evaluated include closed-source APIs and open-source models.
