## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SciTrek

**Overview**: SciTrek is a novel question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using scientific articles, addressing previous limitations with complex questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple full-text scientific articles.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- NeedleBench
- Ada-LEval
- BABILong
- HELMET
- LongMemEval

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models using a novel method of constructing question-answering pairs from scientific articles and corresponding SQL queries.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Scientific articles from Semantic Scholar

**Size**: 21,664 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated via SQL queries against a constructed database.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Exact Match
