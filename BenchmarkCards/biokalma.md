# BioKaLMA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BioKaLMA

**Overview**: BioKaLMA is a benchmark dataset facilitating Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), which evaluates the ability of language models to generate attributed answers using structured knowledge from knowledge graphs. It includes a unique task design focusing on citation generation from knowledge graphs.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- N/A

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lixinze777/Knowledge-aware-Language-Model-Attribution)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To propose a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution to improve the reliability of language models in generating accurate citations.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from biographical data using evolutionary question generation methods and a knowledge graph.

**Size**: 1,085 entries

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
