# PEARL (Persona and knowledgE Augmented Recommendation diaLogues)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: PEARL (Persona and knowledgE Augmented Recommendation diaLogues)

**Overview**: PEARL is a large-scale conversational recommendation dataset synthesized with persona- and knowledge-augmented LLM simulators, containing over 57,000 dialogues to address limitations of existing datasets in expressing user preferences and providing explanations for recommendations.

**Data Type**: dialogue pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ReDial
- INSPIRED

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DLI-Lab/pearl)
