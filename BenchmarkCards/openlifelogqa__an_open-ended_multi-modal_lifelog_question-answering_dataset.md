**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Lifelog dataset from Lifelog Search Challenge 2024 (LSC'24)

**Size**: 14,187 QA pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated by training volunteers and a large language model (GPT-4o).

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- LLM-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- BERTScore
- ROUGE-L
- LLM Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are computed based on word-level overlap and semantic matching of predicted and ground truth answers.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better alignment between generated answers and ground truth.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline performance of 89.7% BERT Score, 25.87% ROUGE-L and 3.9665 LLM Score from LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave 7B model.

**Validation**: Data split into training (11,159 QA pairs), validation (approximately 1,500 QA pairs), and test sets (approximately 1,500 QA pairs).
