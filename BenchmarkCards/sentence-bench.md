# Sentence-Bench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Sentence-Bench

**Overview**: The first sentence-level benchmarking dataset designed to assess G2P performance on sentence-level phonetic challenges of the Persian language.

**Data Type**: sentence-level phoneme sequences

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Persian

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MahtaFetrat/SentenceBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate G2P tools on sentence-level challenges and improve pronunciation prediction for polyphone words and context-sensitive phonemes in Persian.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Annotated sentences selected from CommonVoice and ManaTTS datasets, along with constructed sentences containing polyphone words.

**Size**: 400 sentences

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation of phonetic sequences for selected sentences.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Prompting techniques
- Post-processing methods

**Metrics**:
- Phoneme Error Rate (PER)
- Polyphone accuracy
- Ezafe prediction accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the model's performance in phoneme prediction.

**Interpretation**: Lower PER indicates better phonetic accuracy; higher accuracy in polyphone predictions signifies better contextual understanding.

**Validation**: Performed by comparing model outputs against phoneme-annotated sentences.
