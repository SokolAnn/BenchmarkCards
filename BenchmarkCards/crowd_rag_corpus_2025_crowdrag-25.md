# Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25)

**Overview**: The Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for 301 topics, including utility judgments across various dimensions, aimed at evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios.

**Data Type**: RAG response pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://zenodo.org/records/14748980)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/webis-de/sigir25-rag-crowdsourcing)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for evaluation in retrieval-augmented generation scenarios, analyzing response writing and judgement.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Evaluation
- Response Generation

**Limitations**: The study uses a specific set of topics from TREC RAG'24 which may limit generalizability.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Crowdsourced human workers and LLM (OpenAI's GPT-4 model) for generating and judging RAG responses.

**Size**: 1,806 RAG responses, 47,320 pairwise human judgments

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Responses written by crowdsourced workers and evaluated by both human and LLM judgments.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Crowdsourcing
- Pairwise Judgments

**Metrics**:
- Agreement Scores
- Utility Judgment Dimensions

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated using pairwise comparisons for assessing response quality.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better responses according to utility dimensions such as coherence and coverage.

**Validation**: Validated through expert judgments and inter-rater reliability measures.
