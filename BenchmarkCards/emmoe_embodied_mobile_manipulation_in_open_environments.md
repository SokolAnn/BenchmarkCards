## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and advance the development of intelligent autonomous robots through the execution of language-based tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Robotics Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Mobile Manipulation
- Task Planning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: EMMOE-100 dataset collected using the Fetch robot in Habitat-Lab 2.0.

**Size**: 100 tasks with 966 subtasks

**Format**: JSON, images of execution

**Annotation**: Manually annotated with task attributes, execution success status, and feedback mechanisms after failures.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Task Progress (TP)
- Success Rate (SR)
- Success End Rate (SER)
- Success Re-plan Rate (SRR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on task execution success, keypath sequences for TP, and counting re-plans for SRR.

**Interpretation**: Higher values in TP, SR, SER, and SRR indicate better performance and reliability of the robotic agent.

**Baseline Results**: HOMIE BOT-7B with SFT+DPO achieved high success rates across various metrics.

**Validation**: Benchmark validated through systematic comparison of performance across multiple robotic models and tasks.
