## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset and framework for studying the extraction and generation of limitations in research articles.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners
- Academic Authors

**Tasks**:
- Limitation Extraction
- Limitation Generation

**Limitations**: The dataset is primarily focused on specific NLP and machine learning conferences which may limit broader applicability.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Dataset extracted from papers and peer reviews from ACL, NeurIPS, and PeerJ.

**Size**: 6,932 NeurIPS papers, 5,739 ACL papers, and 1,000 PeerJ papers.

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Extracted limitations annotated with LLM assistance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- LLM-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROUGE-L
- BERTScore

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on comparisons between extracted limitations and ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better extraction accuracy for limitations.

**Validation**: Evaluated through human annotation comparing LLM extractions against established limitations.
