## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive multilingual benchmark for sentence simplification to enable the development and evaluation of multilingual models and metrics.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Simplification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A collection of existing multilingual text simplification corpora unified into a single format.

**Size**: 1,749,056 complex-simple sentence pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Data collected from published literature and various methodologies

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- SARI
- BLEU

**Calculation**: SARI is the average of the F1 score for adding, keeping, and deleting n-grams. BLEU evaluates the overlap of generated simplifications with reference simplifications.

**Interpretation**: Higher SARI and BLEU scores indicate better performance in text simplification tasks.

**Baseline Results**: Common baselines include Identity and Truncation methods.

**Validation**: Validation through human evaluation and comparison with baseline results.
