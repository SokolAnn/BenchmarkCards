## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the capability of LLMs in generating syntactically and logically accurate LaTeX code from natural language instructions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: The Hard set‚Äôs restricted size of 40 samples may challenge the generalizability of findings.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Aggregation of atomic LaTeX commands from various scientific document templates and Overleaf documentation.

**Size**: 440 examples

**Format**: Structured dataset with natural language instructions and corresponding LaTeX code.

**Annotation**: Manually extracted and verified atomic LaTeX commands.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
