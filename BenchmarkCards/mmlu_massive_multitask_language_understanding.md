# MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)

**Overview**: This study evaluates Reasoning CPT, which uses synthetic data with hidden thoughts to improve reasoning capabilities across multiple domains including STEM and Law, compared to standard Continual Pretraining (CPT).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Legal
- Education

**Languages**:
- English
