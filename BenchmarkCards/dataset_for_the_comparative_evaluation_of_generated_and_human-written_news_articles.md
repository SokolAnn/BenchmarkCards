# Dataset for the Comparative Evaluation of Generated and Human-Written News Articles

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Dataset for the Comparative Evaluation of Generated and Human-Written News Articles

**Overview**: The study establishes a new curated dataset that contains 2,100 human-written articles and 56,700 synthetic articles generated by nine LLMs, designed to analyze political bias in journalistic content.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Journalism

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FilipT/Generated_News_Political_Leaning)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a structured dataset for quantifiable experiments on political bias in generative language models within the journalistic domain.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Journalism Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Political Bias Detection
- Text Generation

**Limitations**: The dataset may exhibit degenerative patterns and is primarily suitable for the Euro-American political context. Its relevance may diminish with advances in text generation technologies.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset includes articles from the NEWSROOM dataset and synthetic articles generated from human-written summaries.

**Size**: 56,700 articles and 2,100 human-written articles

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Annotated based on political bias evaluated through supervised models and LLMs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- Supervised bias detection models

**Metrics**:
- Political bias shift

**Calculation**: Political bias shift is calculated as the difference in political bias scores between human-written and generated articles.

**Interpretation**: A positive score indicates a shift towards a right-wing bias, while a negative score indicates a left-wing bias.

**Validation**: Validation was performed comparing results from both supervised models and LLMs for bias assessment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Privacy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Privacy**: Personal information in data

**Demographic Analysis**: The dataset focuses on political bias but does not include specific demographic breakdowns.

**Potential Harm**: The dataset and findings reveal risks associated with political bias in generated articles, which may influence public opinion and information consumption.
