# Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD)

**Overview**: The Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) is designed to evaluate models along key cross-cultural psychological dimensions, specifically Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI), enabling systematic measurement of cultural values in large language models.

**Data Type**: value-dilemma probes, scenario-judgment probes, stereotype-association probes

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To investigate the extent to which large language models internalize cultural values from their training data and to develop a systematic methodology for identifying and measuring these 'cultural genes'.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Ethicists
- Cultural Studies Scholars

**Tasks**:
- Cultural Value Assessment
- Bias Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) was created via a multi-stage process incorporating theories from cross-cultural psychology and computational linguistics.

**Size**: 200 probes

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Probes validated via expert review and bilingual annotation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantitative scoring
- Qualitative thematic analysis

**Metrics**:
- Cultural Dimension Score (CDS)
- Cultural Alignment Index (CAI)
- Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)

**Calculation**: Mean scores calculated for each cultural dimension across all probes.

**Interpretation**: Scores indicate alignment with cultural norms, providing insight into the cultural tendencies of models.

**Validation**: Substantial agreement (Kappa score of 0.83) in manual annotations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Ethical Compliance

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias, Output bias
- **Societal Impact**: Impact on affected communities

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A
