# SEAR Dataset

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SEAR Dataset

**Overview**: The SEAR Dataset is a novel multimodal resource designed to study the emerging threat of social engineering (SE) attacks orchestrated through augmented reality (AR) and multimodal large language models (LLMs). This dataset captures 180 annotated conversations across 60 participants in simulated adversarial scenarios, including meetings, classes and networking events.

**Data Type**: multimodal data including conversations, audio, and visual cues

**Domains**:
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Cybersecurity

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/INSLabCN/SEAR-Dataset)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to provide a resource for studying AR-LLM-driven social engineering behaviors and facilitating the development of defensive mechanisms against such attacks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Cybersecurity Practitioners
- Human-Computer Interaction Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Social Engineering Behavior Analysis
- AR-LLM Interaction Modeling

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Simulated adversarial scenarios with 60 participants engaged in social engineering interactions.

**Size**: 180 annotated conversations

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by researchers

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Trust ratings
- Susceptibility assessments

**Calculation**: Analysis of participant responses and contextual interactions during simulations.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores in trust and engagement metrics indicate increased susceptibility to social engineering tactics.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: IRB-approved human study with varied conversation settings.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Privacy
- Fairness
- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
