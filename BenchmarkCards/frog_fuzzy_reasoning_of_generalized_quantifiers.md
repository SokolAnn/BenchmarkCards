## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FROG (Fuzzy Reasoning of Generalized Quantifiers)

**Overview**: FROG is a benchmark for evaluating fuzzy reasoning capabilities in large language models, consisting of real-world mathematical word problems that incorporate generalized quantifiers.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Mathematics

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- GSM8K
- MathQA

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the fuzzy reasoning abilities of large language models and examine challenges associated with fuzzy logic in mathematical reasoning problems.

**Target Audience**:
- Research Scientists
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Mathematical Reasoning

**Limitations**: The questions constructed may not naturally occur and the masking-based reasoning protocol may not reflect real-world reasoning processes.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from GSM8K and MathQA datasets

**Size**: 2,044 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated based on fuzzy reasoning tasks involving generalized quantifiers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is measured as the proportion of correctly answered questions out of the total questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in reasoning tasks, while a lower accuracy indicates challenges in fuzzy reasoning.

**Baseline Results**: The best performing model, GPT-4-turbo, achieved below 50% accuracy across different settings.

**Validation**: Evaluated using several open-sourced LLMs with various masking strategies.
