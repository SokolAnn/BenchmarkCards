# PropaGaze

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: PropaGaze

**Overview**: PropaGaze is a novel dataset for fine-grained propaganda analysis, combining human-annotated data with synthetic data. It aims to enhance understanding of propaganda techniques, appeals, and underlying intent across contexts, specifically for news articles related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other political domains.

**Data Type**: human-annotated and synthetic text data

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- PTC (Propaganda Techniques Corpus)

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Lumos-Jiateng/PropaInsight)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive dataset for analyzing propaganda techniques, appeals, and underlying intent, thus improving the capabilities of models in detecting and understanding propaganda in various contexts.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Social Scientists
- Journalists

**Tasks**:
- Propaganda Technique Identification
- Appeal Analysis
- Intent Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: PropaGaze dataset constructed through human annotations and synthetic data generation based on real-world articles.

**Size**: 1,169 articles

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human annotation supplemented by synthesized data generated by LLMs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics for performance testing

**Metrics**:
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- BertScore

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the overlap between identified text spans and actual propaganda spans, as well as the semantic similarity of generated responses.

**Interpretation**: Higher IoU and BertScore indicate better model performance in identifying propaganda techniques and appeals.

**Baseline Results**: Performance compared to MGNN and LLMs in both data-rich and data-sparse settings, with specifics provided in the related results section.

**Validation**: Validation was performed through rigorous evaluation of both human-annotated and synthetic data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Safety
- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Robustness**: Data poisoning
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: ['Potential misuse of generated synthetic propaganda content to mislead or manipulate public opinion.']
