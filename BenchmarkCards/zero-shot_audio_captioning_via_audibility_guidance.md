# ZERO-SHOT AUDIO CAPTIONING VIA AUDIBILITY GUIDANCE

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ZERO-SHOT AUDIO CAPTIONING VIA AUDIBILITY GUIDANCE

**Overview**: We propose a novel zero-shot audio captioning method that addresses the challenges of fluency, faithfulness, and audibility. Our method employs transfer learning from three neural networks, culminating in a dataset carefully generated by ChatGPT that contains audible and inaudible caption samples.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- AudioCaps

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To introduce a zero-shot audio captioning method that enhances the audibility of generated captions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Audio Captioning

**Limitations**: The solution does not effectively identify or distinguish between multiple speakers or sources of sound within the same audio segment.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated by ChatGPT using prompts designed to create audible and inaudible caption samples.

**Size**: 15,385 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by instructing GPT-4.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- BLEU
- METEOR
- ROUGE-L
- CIDEr

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on comparisons to ground truth captions.

**Interpretation**: The evaluation shows improvements in audibility and overall quality of captions.

**Baseline Results**: Compared to a baseline where no audibility guidance is applied.

**Validation**: User studies indicate 86% of users prefer the audibility-guided captions.
