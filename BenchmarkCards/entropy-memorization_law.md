# Entropy-Memorization Law

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Entropy-Memorization Law

**Overview**: This paper presents the Entropy-Memorization Law, which characterizes the relationship between data entropy and memorization difficulty in LLMs, offering a method to distinguish between training and testing datasets, enabling dataset inference.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- LiveBench
- MIMIR

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06056)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To explore how to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs and to develop a method for distinguishing training from testing data.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Dataset Inference

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: OLMo family of open models and their associated datasets.

**Size**: 240,000 examples and 300,000 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Linear regression analysis
- Entropy estimation
- Dataset Inference (DI)

**Metrics**:
- Pearson correlation
- Levenshtein Distance (edit distance)

**Calculation**: Levenshtein distance measures the differences between responses and answers at the token level.

**Interpretation**: Higher memorization scores indicate lower similarity between generated responses and reference answers.

**Baseline Results**: Pearson r values reached up to 0.972 in testing.

**Validation**: Algorithm validated through regression on experimental data from the OLMo models.
