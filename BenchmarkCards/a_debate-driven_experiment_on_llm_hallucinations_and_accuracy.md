# A Debate-Driven Experiment on LLM Hallucinations and Accuracy

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: A Debate-Driven Experiment on LLM Hallucinations and Accuracy

**Overview**: This study investigates the phenomenon of hallucination in LLMs through a debate-like interaction among multiple GPT-4o-Mini models. One model generates false answers while others respond truthfully, aiming to assess the impact of misinformation on model performance.

**Data Type**: Text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- TruthfulQA

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19485)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To analyze how misinformation affects the outputs of large language models during inter-model interactions and improve their robustness.

**Target Audience**:
- AI Researchers
- Data Scientists
- Developers

**Tasks**:
- Mitigation of LLM hallucinations
- Assessment of model accuracy
- Improvement of inter-model interactions

**Limitations**: Fixed number of debaters and single type of saboteur strategy.
