# ScanBot

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ScanBot

**Overview**: ScanBot is the first instruction-conditioned, multimodal dataset designed explicitly for high-precision surface scanning tasks in robotic systems.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop a dataset that enables research on tool-specific embodied perception beyond traditional manipulation, facilitating instruction-conditioned policy learning in robotic surface scanning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Roboticists
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Surface Scanning
- Defect Inspection
- Comparative Analysis
- Functional Target Scanning

**Limitations**: The current version of ScanBot assumes flat surfaces, limiting its applicability to objects with curved or irregular geometries. It is also designed for open-loop scanning which does not adapt based on scan quality during execution.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Dataset generated through a structured protocol involving high-precision sensors and a robotic system.

**Size**: 896 scans

**Format**: multimodal data including RGB, depth, and laser profiles

**Annotation**: Data annotated with multi-task natural language commands.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Model evaluation through benchmarking VLA models on specific scanning tasks.

**Metrics**:
- Surface Reconstruction Accuracy
- Waypoint Jitter Minimization
- Instruction Grounding Accuracy

**Calculation**: Model performance metrics are calculated based on the accuracy of selected scanner parameters, localization of objects based on instructions, and fidelity of the reconstructed surfaces compared to ground-truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy metrics indicate better model performance in generating stable scanning trajectories and precise interpretations of natural language instructions.

**Baseline Results**: Existing VLA models show poor performance with average accuracies below 50% in selection of parameters and task execution.

**Validation**: Validation procedures involve comparing model outputs against ground-truth scans captured under controlled conditions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Robustness**: Data poisoning

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: ['Misalignment in scanning leading to poor data quality.']
