## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of ByteSized32Refactored is to evaluate the ability of large language models to generate task-specific world environments through interactive text games.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Game Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Game Generation

**Limitations**: The ByteSized32Refactored corpus alters token distribution and code structure, raising the possibility that observed improvements stem from structural biases rather than genuine advancements in modeling ability.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Refactored corpus contains 32 task-specific text games.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: Python

**Annotation**: Games are generated and evaluated using GPT-4o.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Self-reflection evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Technical Validity
- Specification Compliance
- Physical Reality Alignment
- Winnability

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the performance of games generated by the GPT-4o model on the ByteSized32Refactored corpus.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores in metrics indicate improved capabilities of LLMs in generating task-compliant and physically realistic text games.

**Baseline Results**: Performance comparison between ByteSized32Refactored and original ByteSized32 shows varying results across evaluation metrics.

**Validation**: Evaluation performed by testing games for technical validity, compliance, alignment, and winnability.
