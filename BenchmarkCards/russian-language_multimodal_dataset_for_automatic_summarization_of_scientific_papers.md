# Russian-Language Multimodal Dataset for Automatic Summarization of Scientific Papers

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Russian-Language Multimodal Dataset for Automatic Summarization of Scientific Papers

**Overview**: The paper discusses the creation of a multimodal dataset of Russian-language scientific papers and testing of existing language models for the task of automatic text summarization.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Russian

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iis-research-team/summarization-dataset)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create a dataset for the scientific papers summarization for Russian, covering different domains including technical, humanitarian, and natural sciences.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Automatic Text Summarization

**Limitations**: Current version of the dataset covers only 7 scientific domains, but it should be increased to include more diverse areas.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from three scientific journals covering Economics, History, Information Technologies, Journalism, Law, Linguistics, and Medicine.

**Size**: 420 texts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- BERTScore
- BLEURT
- ROUGE-1
- ROUGE-2
- ROUGE-L
- BLEU

**Calculation**: Metrics like BERTScore and BLEURT calculate the similarity based on pre-trained embeddings, while ROUGE metrics calculate overlapping n-grams.

**Interpretation**: Values near 1 for metrics indicate better matches.

**Baseline Results**: The models were evaluated against the reference abstracts from the dataset.

**Validation**: The quality of generated abstracts was compared with the reference summaries.
