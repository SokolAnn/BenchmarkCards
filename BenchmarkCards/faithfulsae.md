# FaithfulSAE

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: FaithfulSAE

**Overview**: FaithfulSAE is a method that trains Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on the model’s own synthetic dataset, leading to improved stability and faithfulness in the representation of model-internal features, reducing the issue of 'Fake Features'.

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve the interpretability of Sparse Autoencoders by training them on synthetic datasets that reflect the model's own distribution, eliminating reliance on external datasets.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Interpretable AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Feature Extraction
- Model Interpretation

**Limitations**: While effective, the Faithful Dataset may not fully cover the complexities of high-dimensional feature spaces and lacks evaluation on instruction-tuned or reasoning models.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Synthetic dataset generated by the model itself.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Feature Matching
- Comparative Stability Evaluation
- SAE Probing

**Metrics**:
- Shared Feature Ratio
- Cross-Entropy Difference
- L2 Reconstruction Error
- Explained Variance

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated by measuring the differences and performance across different seed initializations for SAEs trained on various datasets.

**Interpretation**: Higher Shared Feature Ratio (SFR) indicates better stability and interpretability of the features captured by the SAEs.

**Baseline Results**: SAEs trained on Faithful dataset exhibited a higher SFR and a lower Fake Feature Ratio compared to those trained on other datasets.

**Validation**: Compared and validated against web-based datasets for performance evaluation.
