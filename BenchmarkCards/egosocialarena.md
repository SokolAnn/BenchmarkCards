## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate the social intelligence of large language models from a first-person perspective.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- ToM Reasoning
- Behavioral Evaluation
- Situational Understanding

**Limitations**: Our study only involves the text modality and does not utilize ego-centric images and videos; the evaluation is limited to eight prominent foundation LLMs.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from static ToM benchmarks, dynamic interaction scenarios, and situational assessments.

**Size**: 2,245 data entries

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually verified and corrected after generation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Win rate
- Goal completion

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on LLM performance in various tasks compared to a human baseline.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in social intelligence tasks evaluated from a first-person perspective.

**Baseline Results**: Human performance serves as a baseline, with average scores across various scenarios.

**Validation**: Two rounds of validation for data integrity and quality, leading to an average agreement of 97.6%.
