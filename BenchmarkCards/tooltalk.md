## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-using LLM-powered assistants in a conversational context.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Tool Usage Evaluation
- Conversational AI Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: ToolTalk dataset generated by simulations of user interactions requiring multiple tool calls.

**Size**: 78 conversations with 178 total turns

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Ground truth annotations for tool invocations provided for automated evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation with simulated tool execution
- Analysis of LLM responses and tool call accuracy

**Metrics**:
- Conversation-level success rate
- Tool invocation recall
- Incorrect action rate
