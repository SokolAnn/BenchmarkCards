# NAP2 (Naturalness and Privacy-Preserving Text Rewriting)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: NAP2 (Naturalness and Privacy-Preserving Text Rewriting)

**Overview**: The NAP2 dataset focuses on naturalness and privacy-preserving methods for text rewriting, providing a corpus for researchers to develop and evaluate strategies for sanitizing sensitive text while maintaining privacy and utility.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and improve text rewriting techniques that maintain privacy while ensuring natural language quality.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Rewriting

**Limitations**: The dataset might not fulfill the expansive needs of commercial deployments due to its limited size.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from the open-domain dialogue corpus PERSONA-CHAT.

**Size**: 4,795 utterances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human annotation and using large language models for synthetic data generation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
