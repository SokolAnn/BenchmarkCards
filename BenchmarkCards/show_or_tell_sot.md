## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to evaluate both visual and textual prompting methods within the context of semantic segmentation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Semantic Segmentation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: 14 datasets covering common scenes, urban environments, food items, waste items, tools, and land-cover

**Size**: 14 datasets

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)

**Calculation**: The metrics are calculated by evaluating the predictions against the ground truth annotations.

**Interpretation**: Higher mIoU scores indicate better segmentation performance.

**Validation**: The evaluation uses both validation and test sets from the datasets.
