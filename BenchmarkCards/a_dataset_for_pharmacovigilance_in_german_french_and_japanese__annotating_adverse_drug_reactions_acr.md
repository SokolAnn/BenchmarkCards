# A Dataset for Pharmacovigilance in German, French, and Japanese: Annotating Adverse Drug Reactions across Languages

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: A Dataset for Pharmacovigilance in German, French, and Japanese: Annotating Adverse Drug Reactions across Languages

**Overview**: This paper presents a multilingual corpus of texts concerning Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in German, French, and Japanese. The corpus includes annotations covering 12 entity types, four attribute types, and 13 relation types to aid in the extraction and analysis of ADRs from user-generated content.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- German
- French
- Japanese

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To support pharmacovigilance across languages by extracting information on ADRs from user-generated content.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Named Entity Recognition
- Attribute Classification
- Relation Extraction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data
