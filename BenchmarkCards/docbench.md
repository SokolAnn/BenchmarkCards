# DOCBENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: DOCBENCH

**Overview**: DOCBENCH aims to provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating LLM-based document reading systems under diverse real-world scenarios, where the systems take a document file paired with one or multiple related questions as input and generate textual responses as output.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Anni-Zou/DocBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Establish a standardized benchmark for evaluating LLM-based document reading systems.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data was collected from publicly accessible online resources, including arXiv, company annual reports, government publications, and news articles.

**Size**: 229 documents and 1,102 questions

**Format**: PDF

**Annotation**: Questions generated by human annotators and synthetic question generation using models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics using GPT-4

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Scores are assigned using a binary system based on correctness assessed by both human annotators and GPT-4.

**Interpretation**: Accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correct answers identified by the evaluators.

**Baseline Results**: Human performance accuracy is 83.0% across domains.

**Validation**: Evaluation involves human annotators and automated scoring using LLMs.
