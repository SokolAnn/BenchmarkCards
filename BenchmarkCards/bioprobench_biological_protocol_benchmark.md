# BioProBench (Biological Protocol Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BioProBench (Biological Protocol Benchmark)

**Overview**: BioProBench is the first large-scale, integrated multi-task benchmark for biological protocol understanding and reasoning, featuring over 556K high-quality structured instances derived from 27K high-quality protocols.

**Data Type**: structured instances

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Biomedical Sciences

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- BioASQ
- PubMedQA

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating the capabilities of large language models in understanding, reasoning about, and generating biological protocols.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Protocol Question Answering
- Step Ordering
- Error Correction
- Protocol Generation
- Protocol Reasoning

**Limitations**: The benchmark may introduce subtle inaccuracies due to reliance on LLMs for task generation and focuses only on textual inputs, lacking real-world multimodal context.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from authoritative resources including Bio-protocol, Protocol Exchange, JOVE, Nature Protocols, Morimoto Lab, and Protocols.io.

**Size**: 556,171 structured task instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Structured annotation based on key elements extraction and hierarchical relationships in biological protocols.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- BLEU
- ROUGE-L

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on standard NLP measures alongside novel domain-specific metrics such as keyword-based content and embedding-based structural metrics.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better understanding and generation capabilities in procedural biological contexts.

**Baseline Results**: Evaluation of 12 mainstream LLMs shows varied performance on benchmark tasks.

**Validation**: Multi-stage quality control including automated filtering and manual reviews by domain experts.
