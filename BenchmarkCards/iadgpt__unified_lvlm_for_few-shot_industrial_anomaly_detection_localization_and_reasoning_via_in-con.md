# IADGPT: Unified LVLM for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection, Localization, and Reasoning via In-Context Learning

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: IADGPT: Unified LVLM for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection, Localization, and Reasoning via In-Context Learning

**Overview**: We present a new dataset comprising 100K images across 400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level textual annotations, and we propose a unified framework, IADGPT, for performing few-shot industrial anomaly detection in a human-like manner.

**Data Type**: image with textual annotations

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop a unified LVLM that can perform few-shot industrial anomaly detection, localization, and reasoning efficiently across diverse product categories.

**Target Audience**:
- Industry Practitioners
- ML Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Anomaly Detection
- Localization
- Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A dataset comprising 100K images across 400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level textual annotations.

**Size**: 100,000 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated descriptions for each image from different perspectives using a vision-language model.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- In-Context Learning
- Training on Few-shot Examples

**Metrics**:
- Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the model's prediction confidence on the images.

**Interpretation**: Higher AUC indicates better performance in anomaly detection and localization tasks.

**Validation**: The dataset was constructed and validated to ensure diversity and extensive annotation.
