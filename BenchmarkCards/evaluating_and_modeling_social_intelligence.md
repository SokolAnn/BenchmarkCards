# Evaluating and Modeling Social Intelligence

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Evaluating and Modeling Social Intelligence

**Overview**: The study introduces a benchmark for evaluating social intelligence, focusing on two tasks: Inverse Reasoning (IR) and Inverse Inverse Planning (IIP). It aims to compare human and AI capabilities in social dynamics through these tasks.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark for evaluating social intelligence that compares human and AI capabilities, specifically through the tasks of Inverse Reasoning and Inverse Inverse Planning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Cognitive Scientists
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Inverse Reasoning
- Inverse Inverse Planning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated datasets for Inverse Reasoning and Inverse Inverse Planning tasks.

**Size**: 987 instances in total (487 for IR, 500 for IIP)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated and structured based on specific tasks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics were calculated based on the performance of humans versus LLMs on the proposed tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better social intelligence understanding; humans were expected to outperform LLMs.

**Baseline Results**: Performance metrics for various LLMs compared to human performance were reported, showing LLMs at basic social intelligence levels.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the framework and tasks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
