# Pento-D IARef

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Pento-D IARef

**Overview**: A diagnostic dataset in a visual domain of puzzle pieces where referring expressions are generated by a well-known symbolic algorithm (the 'Incremental Algorithm'). The dataset is used to study whether neural models can learn the referring expression production strategy of the Incremental Algorithm.

**Data Type**: image-text pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/clp-research/pento-diaref)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To study whether neural models can learn the referring expression production strategy of the Incremental Algorithm (IA) from visual inputs and generated expressions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Referring Expression Generation

**Limitations**: The dataset relies on an abstracted visual domain, limiting real-world variability and naturalness in expressions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic data generated using the Incremental Algorithm applied to Pentomino shapes.

**Size**: 148,000 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated via symbolic algorithm.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Neural Network Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score
- Sentence-wise Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the matching of predicted expressions to the ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher BLEU scores and sentence-wise accuracy indicate better performance in generating accurate referring expressions.

**Baseline Results**: The best Transformer+ VSE model achieved a BLEU score of 97% on the in-distribution test data.

**Validation**: The models were validated based on performance during training epochs with careful monitoring of BLEU and accuracy scores.
