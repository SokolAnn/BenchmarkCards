## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the security capabilities of large language models in generating malicious code and their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Security Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Malicious Code Generation

**Limitations**: Only Qwen - Turbo used for generating jailbreaking questions; limited scope of 320 requirements.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: 320 manually crafted malicious requirements covering multiple programming languages and operating systems.

**Size**: 3,520 prompts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually crafted by experts in the field.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Direct input evaluation
- Jailbreak prompt mutation

**Metrics**:
- Refusal rate
- Quality metric score ranging from 1 to 4

**Calculation**: Evaluation involves scoring based on whether models refuse to answer and the quality of their responses.

**Interpretation**: Scores indicate the models' ability to reject malicious inputs and quality of responses from irrelevant to well-developed harmful code.

**Baseline Results**: Average rejection rate of malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% under jailbreak methods.

**Validation**: Evaluated against 29 models using LLMs, including mainstream and open-source.
