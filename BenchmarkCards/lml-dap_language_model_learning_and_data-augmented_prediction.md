# LML-DAP (Language Model Learning and Data-Augmented Prediction)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LML-DAP (Language Model Learning and Data-Augmented Prediction)

**Overview**: The paper introduces a new approach for classification tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) through a method called 'Language Model Learning (LML)' and 'Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)', enabling interpretability and context-aware decisions while achieving satisfactory accuracy levels.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Pro-GenAI/LML-DAP)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To replace traditional machine learning with a system that allows LLMs to perform accurate, transparent, and explainable classifications using LML and DAP.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Data Scientists
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Multiple datasets from the UCI dataset repository including Iris, Wine, Zoo, Raisin, Rice, and Mushroom.

**Size**: Varied sizes across multiple datasets

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by LLMs based on data summarization.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is determined by comparing the model's predictions with the ground truth labels of the test data.

**Interpretation**: An accuracy of 80% or above is considered satisfactory, while 90% and above is deemed excellent.

**Validation**: The proposed system's performance is validated through testing across various datasets and models.
