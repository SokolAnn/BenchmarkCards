# A Framework and Dataset for Abstract Art Generation via CalligraphyGAN

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: A Framework and Dataset for Abstract Art Generation via CalligraphyGAN

**Overview**: This paper presents a creative framework based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and Contextual Neural Language Model to generate abstract artworks from Chinese dish names, along with a publicly released dataset of Chinese calligraphy images.

**Data Type**: image

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To generate abstract artworks drawing inspiration from Chinese calligraphy linked with dish names.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Artists
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Image Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Collected from the Internet, featuring 138,499 images of Chinese calligraphy characters written by 19 calligraphers covering 7328 different characters.

**Size**: 138,499 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
