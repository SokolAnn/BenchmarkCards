## üíæ Data

**Source**: Public dataset of household energy consumption from London, collected through smart meters.

**Size**: 5,567 households

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Statistical methods
- Machine Learning models
- Language Models
- Time Series Foundation Models

**Metrics**:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

**Calculation**: Each metric was computed based on the average of five runs, averaged per household and aggregated across all households.

**Interpretation**: Models with lower error rates indicate better performance in gap-filling tasks.
