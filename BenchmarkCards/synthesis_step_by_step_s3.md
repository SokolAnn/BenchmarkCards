# Synthesis Step by Step (S3)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Synthesis Step by Step (S3)

**Overview**: S3 is a data synthesis framework that reduces the distribution gap between synthesized datasets and real-world distributions by iteratively extrapolating the errors of a small model trained on synthesized data, improving data efficiency in training models with limited labeled data.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve data efficiency in training small models by synthesizing high-quality datasets that better match real-world data distributions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Natural Language Inference
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The framework is not stable across different prompts and assumes that the large language model has good knowledge of tasks.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthesized datasets through the S3 framework utilizing large language models.

**Size**: 21,200 examples (average for IMDb dataset)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by the S3 framework.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
