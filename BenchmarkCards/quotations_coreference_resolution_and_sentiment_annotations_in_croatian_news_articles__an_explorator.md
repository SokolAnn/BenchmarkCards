## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Quotations, Coreference Resolution, and Sentiment Annotations in Croatian News Articles: An Exploratory Study

**Overview**: This paper presents a corpus annotated for the task of direct-speech extraction in Croatian. The paper focuses on the annotation of the quotation, co-reference resolution, and sentiment annotation in SETimes news corpus in Croatian and on the analysis of its language-specific differences compared to English. From this, a list of the phenomena that require special attention when performing these annotations is derived. The generated corpus with quotation features annotations can be used for multiple tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing.

**Tasks**:
- Quote Extraction
- Speaker Identification
- Verb-cue Classification
- Coreference Resolution
- Sentiment Analysis

**Limitations**: Preliminary/gold-standard data; focused only on direct quotes; annotated subset of 140 documents; annotations performed by a Croatian native speaker (single annotator).
