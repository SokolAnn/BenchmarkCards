# Mathematical Entities: Corpora and Benchmarks

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Mathematical Entities: Corpora and Benchmarks

**Overview**: This paper provides annotated corpora that can be used to study the language of mathematics in different contexts, ranging from fundamental concepts in textbooks to advanced research mathematics, including models for terminology extraction, definition extraction, and entity linking.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a collection of mathematical language corpora that provide insight and benchmarking for computational linguistics research on mathematics.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Terminology Extraction
- Definition Extraction
- Entity Linking

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Three initial mathematical corpora covering different contexts in the field of category theory.

**Size**: 182,397 sentences

**Format**: Plain text

**Annotation**: Annotations of dependency trees, part of speech tags, generated automatically using spaCy.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation of terminology extraction, definition extraction, and entity linking models.

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the performance of models against extracted benchmarks.

**Interpretation**: Higher precision indicates fewer irrelevant terms predicted, while higher recall indicates better coverage of true terms.

**Validation**: Evaluation involves various models tested against benchmarks derived from the corpora.
