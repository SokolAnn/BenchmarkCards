# CSR-Bench (Computer Science Research Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CSR-Bench (Computer Science Research Benchmark)

**Overview**: CSR-Bench evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling complex code development tasks related to computer science research projects, specifically for tasks including environment setup, data preparation, and model training.

**Data Type**: code repository tasks

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Machine Learning
- Interdisciplinary

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- SWE-bench
- ML-Bench

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess LLMs' abilities to automate the deployment of GitHub repositories for computer science research.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Code Repository Deployment
- Environment Setup
- Data Preparation
- Model Training
- Inference

**Limitations**: CSR-Bench does not address code repositories outside of computer science research topics.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: GitHub repositories of computer science research projects, selected based on tags, popularity, and documentation completeness.

**Size**: 100 repositories

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual checks for README completeness and deployability.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Command generation
- Log analysis
- Issue retrieval
- Web search

**Metrics**:
- Completion Rate

**Calculation**: Completion rate is defined as the ratio of successfully executed commands to the total number of commands.

**Interpretation**: Higher completion rates indicate better performance of LLM agents in automating the deployment process.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluation through Docker environment isolation and multi-agent collaboration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Bias
- Safety

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Privacy**

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: ['Inefficiencies in code deployment processes']

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations
