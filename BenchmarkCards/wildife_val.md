## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the ability of LLMs to follow realistic multi-constrained instructions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Constrained Text Generation
- Instruction Following

**Limitations**: The dataset reflects only the types of tasks that interest the platform users, potentially leading to demographic bias.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real user instructions collected from Chatbot Arena.

**Size**: 12,000 instructions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: User-generated instructions were decomposed into constraints for evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- LLM-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Fraction of constraints fulfilled

**Calculation**: Score is calculated as the relative fraction of fulfilled constraints per task.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in following constraints.

**Validation**: High agreement with human annotations (75%) and significant correlations with existing benchmarks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Fairness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
