## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a rich dataset for multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning, enabling models to accurately identify and explain emotional states using integrated audio, visual, and textual data.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Emotion Recognition
- Emotion Reasoning

**Limitations**: The dataset exhibits some mismatches between emotional cues in a small subset of samples.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed through comprehensive emotion annotation in video data with human and algorithmic contributions, filtered to enhance quality.

**Size**: 33,105 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Combination of manual annotation and automated processes.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
