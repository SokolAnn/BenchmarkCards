# ANESUITE: A COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARK AND DATASET SUITE FOR ANESTHESIOLOGY REASONING IN LLMS

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ANESUITE: A COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARK AND DATASET SUITE FOR ANESTHESIOLOGY REASONING IN LLMS

**Overview**: AnesSuite is the first comprehensive dataset suite specifically designed for anesthesiology reasoning in large language models (LLMs), including an evaluation benchmark (AnesBench) and various training datasets to facilitate fine-tuning and model development.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions, question-answer pairs, reasoning chains, plain text documents

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MiliLab/AnesSuite)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve anesthesiology reasoning capabilities in large language models by providing a comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Medical Reasoning Evaluation

**Limitations**: The System 2 questions are constructed from abstract scenarios rather than real clinical cases.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: AnesSuite includes datasets from authoritative anesthesiology sources, PubMed, and web-based document collections.

**Size**: 4.4k English MCQs, 3.5k Chinese MCQs, 2.4M documents, 20k QA pairs, 10k reasoning chains

**Format**: Plain Text, JSON

**Annotation**: Questions annotated for cognitive demand levels and validated through manual reviews.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the proportion of correct responses to total questions in AnesBench.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better reasoning capabilities in anesthesiology.

**Baseline Results**: Morpheus models achieve significant performance on AnesBench, indicating the effectiveness of AnesSuite.

**Validation**: Models evaluated on multiple-choice questions across various complexities.
