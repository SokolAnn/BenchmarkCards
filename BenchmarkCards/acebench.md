# ACEBench

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: ACEBench

**Overview**: ACEBench is a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in Large Language Models (LLMs), categorizing data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent, and aims to address limitations in existing benchmarks.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

**Similar Benchmarks**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the tool usage capabilities of LLMs through a comprehensive framework covering various scenarios and fine-grained evaluation metrics.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Tool Usage Evaluation
- Multi-Turn Dialogue Assessment

**Limitations**: The quality of generated data may not completely reflect real-world applications, and the manual construction of Agent data may limit diversity.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Automatically generated by LLMs and curated expert data construction.

**Size**: 2,000 entries

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by experts and automatically generated.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Manual evaluation by experts

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- End-to-End Accuracy
- Process Accuracy

**Calculation**: Overall Accuracy is computed as a weighted sum of the accuracies for Normal, Special, and Agent data types.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better tool usage capabilities in evaluated models.

**Validation**: Extensive experimental validation across multiple LLMs.
