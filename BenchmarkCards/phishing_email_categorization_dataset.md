# Phishing Email Categorization Dataset

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Phishing Email Categorization Dataset

**Overview**: A dataset of human categorizations of emails as either dangerous (phishing) or safe (ham), introduced to evaluate the Instance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric, which integrates cognitive models and LLM embeddings.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://osf.io/wbg3r/)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide personalized metrics of subjective concepts that can determine the similarity between sets of text, particularly in educational and recommendation settings.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in NLP
- Educational Technologists
- Cognitive Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Human categorizations of emails collected from an experiment involving 433 participants, assessing emails authored by human cybersecurity experts and GPT-4.

**Size**: 39,230 human judgments

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by human participants

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Cosine Similarity
- Semantic Similarity
- Individualized Similarity (IBIS)

**Calculation**: Similarity is calculated using human judgments of categorization along with metrics based on embeddings and cognitive models.

**Interpretation**: Higher similarity scores indicate greater agreement with human subjective similarity measures.

**Validation**: Comparison with existing similarity metrics to validate the effectiveness of the IBIS method.
