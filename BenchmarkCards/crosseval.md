# CrossEval

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CrossEval

**Overview**: CrossEval is a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with each prompt designed to evaluate both individual and cross capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It systematically explores the intersection of multiple abilities that are often required for real-world tasks.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Spanish

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- GLUE
- SuperGLUE
- MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate large language models on both individual and cross-capabilities, revealing insights on their strengths and weaknesses in handling complex, real-world tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Question Answering
- Mathematical Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Human-annotated prompts following a detailed taxonomy covering individual and cross capabilities of LLMs.

**Size**: 1,400 prompts

**Format**: JSONL

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by expert human annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology
