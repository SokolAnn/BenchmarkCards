## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to provide a comprehensive dataset for training LVLMs to support surgical automation and instruction-following during ESD.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Medical Practitioners
- Robotic Surgeons

**Tasks**:
- Motion Prediction
- Instruction Following

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is constructed from over 35 hours of ESD videos collected using in-vivo porcine models utilizing both robot-assisted and conventional ESD techniques.

**Size**: 17,679 images with 32,699 bounding boxes and 88,395 multi-level motions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated by trained medical professionals with a focus on multi-level surgical motion granularity.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
