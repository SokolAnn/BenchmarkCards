## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To standardize evaluations of backdoor attacks and defenses in Federated Learning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Security Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Image Classification
- Sentiment Analysis
- Next-word Prediction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: CIFAR-10, MNIST, FEMNIST, Sentiment140, Reddit Corpus

**Size**: 805,263 samples for FEMNIST, 1,600,498 samples for Sentiment140

**Format**: Various formats including image datasets and text

**Annotation**: Dataset partitioning simulated among clients using Dirichlet and uniform distributions, including artificial simulation of dataset partitioning.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- Lifespan

**Calculation**: Evaluation metrics calculated across communication rounds after training completion.

**Interpretation**: Higher values of ASR indicate more effective attacks; Lifespan measures persistence of the backdoor.

**Baseline Results**: Comparison made against existing frameworks like FLPoison.

**Validation**: N/A
