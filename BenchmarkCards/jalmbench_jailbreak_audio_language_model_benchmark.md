# JALMBench (Jailbreak Audio Language Model Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: JALMBench (Jailbreak Audio Language Model Benchmark)

**Overview**: JALMBench is the first comprehensive benchmark to assess the safety of Audio Language Models (ALMs) against jailbreak attacks, including a dataset of 2,200 text samples and 51,381 audio samples totaling over 268 hours, along with support for multiple attack and defense methods.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized evaluation framework for assessing the safety of Audio Language Models (ALMs) against jailbreak attacks.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Developers
- Safety Evaluators

**Tasks**:
- Jailbreak Attack Assessment
- Safety Evaluation of ALMs

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from various harmful query methods and generated audio samples.

**Size**: 51,381 audio samples and 2,200 text samples, totaling over 268 hours

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated through automated processes and manual selections.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Attack Success Rate (ASR)

**Calculation**: The ASR is calculated based on the model's response to harmful queries evaluated on a 5-point safety scale.

**Interpretation**: A higher ASR indicates greater vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluated across 12 mainstream ALMs with detailed attack and defense analyses.
