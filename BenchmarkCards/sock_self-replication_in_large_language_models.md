# SOCK (Self-Replication in Large Language Models)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: SOCK (Self-Replication in Large Language Models)

**Overview**: SOCK is a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures large language models’ (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human intervention, defining self-replication based on the model's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself across different computational contexts.

**Data Type**: task performance data

**Domains**:
- Artificial Intelligence

**Languages**:
- English

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Establish a standard for evaluating the self-replication capabilities of large language models to track progress and risks in a consistent and reproducible manner.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Self-Replication Measurement

**Limitations**: Complexity in simulating financial access and external procurement is out of scope for the current suite.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Experiments conducted with various large language models in a controlled CLI environment.

**Size**: 40 model-task pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated logging of task performance metrics.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Task performance evaluation
- Quantitative scoring system

**Metrics**:
- R-score

**Calculation**: The R-score aggregates success, speed, stealth, intelligence, and budget compliance across tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher R-scores represent better self-replication efficiency under realistic constraints.

**Baseline Results**: Across 40 model-task pairs, a success rate of 65% was observed.

**Validation**: Results were validated through repeated experiments with various language models.
