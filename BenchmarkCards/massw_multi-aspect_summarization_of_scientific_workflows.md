## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a structured dataset that facilitates the exploration and optimization of scientific workflows through AI-assisted methods.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Workflow Prediction
- Title Prediction

**Limitations**: The dataset is limited to AI-related computer science publications and may not generalize across other domains.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Automated extraction from over 152,000 peer-reviewed publications collected from 17 leading computer science conferences.

**Size**: 152,000 publications

**Format**: TSV

**Annotation**: Automatically generated through Large Language Models (LLMs) with validation against human annotations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:

- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score
- ROUGE-L
- BERTScore

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated by comparing automated summaries to human-generated reference summaries.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores in BLEU and ROUGE indicate better alignment with human summaries.

**Baseline Results**: GPT-4 outperformed other models in semantic evaluation metrics.

**Validation**: The dataset's summaries were validated against human annotations to ensure quality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
