# SDG-POD (Sustainable Development Goals POlarity Detection)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SDG-POD (Sustainable Development Goals POlarity Detection)

**Overview**: SDG-POD is a benchmark dataset designed specifically for the task of polarity detection in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It combines manually annotated and synthetically generated data to facilitate the training and evaluation of large language models in determining whether a text indicates progress toward a specific SDG or conveys intention to achieve such progress.
