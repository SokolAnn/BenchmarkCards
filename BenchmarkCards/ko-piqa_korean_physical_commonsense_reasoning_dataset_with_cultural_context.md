## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To serve as a benchmark for evaluating Korean language models in physical commonsense reasoning and promote culturally aware AI systems.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Physical Commonsense Reasoning

**Limitations**: The dataset contains only 441 questions, which is smaller than existing benchmarks, potentially limiting its utility for model fine-tuning.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 3.01 million web-crawled Korean questions from Naver Knowledge iN

**Size**: 441 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human validated by native Korean speakers

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Exact match accuracy, where a response is correct only if it exactly matches the ground truth label.

**Interpretation**: Accuracy levels are reported across all questions and broken down by cultural specificity.

**Baseline Results**: Best model achieved 83.22% accuracy, weakest at 59.86%.

**Validation**: Human validation and deduplication were performed before finalizing the dataset.
