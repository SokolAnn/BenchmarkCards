# SpeakerID Benchmark

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: SpeakerID Benchmark

**Overview**: We present a novel, large-scale dataset derived from the MediaSum corpus, encompassing transcripts from a wide range of media sources, aimed at identifying speaker names in dialogue transcripts.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/adobe-research/speaker-identification)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enhance content accessibility and searchability in digital media archives by accurately identifying speakers in dialogues.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Speaker Identification

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: MediaSum corpus, containing transcripts for 463.6K media interviews from National Public Radio (NPR) and Cable News Network (CNN).

**Size**: 17,440 sentences in the training set, 1,719 in the validation set, 1,562 in the test set

**Format**: text

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by text matching based on detected person names in the transcripts.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the number of correctly identified speakers against the total number of speaker mentions.

**Interpretation**: A precision of 80.3% indicates that the model correctly identifies the speaker's name 80.3% of the time when it predicts a speaker.

**Baseline Results**: Best model achieved a precision of 80.3%, recall of 50.0%, and F1 score of 61.6%.

**Validation**: Data was randomly split into train/dev/test sets with a ratio of 8/1/1.
