## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems in terms of collaboration effectiveness and task completion within an interactive cooking scenario.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Game Developers

**Tasks**:
- Collaborative Cooking
- Task Planning
- Dynamic Adaptation

**Limitations**: The benchmark is designed specifically for sequential process-specific tasks, which may not generalize to all possible LLM application scenarios.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Developed from the Overcooked-AI game environment, featuring a simulation setup for interactive collaboration.

**Size**: 30 tasks

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually annotated Referential Action Trajectories (RATs) for evaluation purposes.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Trajectory Efficiency Score (TES)
- Incremental Trajectory Efficiency Score (ITES)
- Progress Completeness (PC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the historical action sequence of agents and defined RATs for collaboration tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better collaboration capabilities and task completion efficiency.

**Baseline Results**: Comparative performance of 13 LLMs, including closed-source and open-source models, highlights varying levels of collaboration efficiency.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments conducted with different models across varying task complexities.
