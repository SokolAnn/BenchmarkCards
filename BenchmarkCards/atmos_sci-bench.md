# ATMOS SCI-BENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ATMOS SCI-BENCH

**Overview**: ATMOS SCI-BENCH is a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. It features a dual-format design comprising both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs).

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Atmospheric Science

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/AtmosSci-Bench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of ATMOS SCI-BENCH is to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in atmospheric science.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Climate Scientists
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Reasoning Assessment
- Scientific Problem Solving

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Questions curated from course materials used in atmospheric science-related classes.

**Size**: 670 multiple-choice questions and 391 open-ended questions
