# AGENT IF (Benchmarking Instruction Following of Large Language Models in Agentic Scenarios)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AGENT IF (Benchmarking Instruction Following of Large Language Models in Agentic Scenarios)

**Overview**: AGENT IF is the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM instruction following ability in agentic scenarios, constructed from 50 realistic applications involving long and complex instructions with multiple constraints.

**Data Type**: instruction-following tasks

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- IFEval
- FollowBench
- SysBench

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/THU-KEG/AgentIF)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a systematic evaluation framework for LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in real-world agentic scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Instruction Following

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real-world agentic applications and industrial frameworks, including open-source agentic systems.

**Size**: 707 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated instructions and constraints by human annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- LLM-based evaluation
- Code verification

**Metrics**:
- Constraint Success Rate (CSR)
- Instruction Success Rate (ISR)

**Calculation**: CSR is calculated by the proportion of individual constraints met, while ISR measures the percentage of instructions with all constraints satisfied.

**Interpretation**: Higher CSR and ISR indicate better performance in following complex and constraint-laden instructions.

**Baseline Results**: Current LLMs show poor performance, with the best model achieving a CSR of only 59.8.

**Validation**: Validated by a hybrid method including human, code-based, and LLM evaluations.
