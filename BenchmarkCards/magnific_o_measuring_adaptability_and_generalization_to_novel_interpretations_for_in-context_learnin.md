# MAGNIFIC O (Measuring Adaptability and Generalization to Novel Interpretations For In-Context Learning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MAGNIFIC O (Measuring Adaptability and Generalization to Novel Interpretations For In-Context Learning)

**Overview**: MAGNIFIC O is an evaluation suite implemented within a text-to-SQL semantic parsing framework designed to analyze large language models' ability to acquire novel interpretations in-context.

**Data Type**: text-to-SQL semantic parsing problems

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Spider

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/MAGNIFICo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the in-context learning capabilities of large language models for novel interpretations.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing

**Limitations**: The evaluation suite MAGNIFIC O was created over a single task, text-to-SQL semantic parsing, and would benefit from validation across other tasks and domains.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data was generated by modifying examples from the Spider dataset and incorporating new interpretations.

**Size**: 1,523 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually verified examples with modifications to incorporate novel interpretations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Execution Accuracy

**Calculation**: Execution accuracy is measured by comparing the output of the generated SQL query with the ground truth output.

**Interpretation**: Higher execution accuracy indicates better performance in learning and generalizing the novel interpretations.

**Baseline Results**: Direct text-to-SQL performance is based on existing examples from the Spider dataset.

**Validation**: Each example in MAGNIFIC O was manually reviewed for correctness.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
