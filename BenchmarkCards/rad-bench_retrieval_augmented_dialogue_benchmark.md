**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from real-world dialogue data for multi-turn interaction scenarios.

**Size**: 89 multi-turn question samples, 267 turns total

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual inspection and scoring through the LLM-as-a-Judge framework.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- LLM-as-a-Judge framework
- Automated scoring
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
