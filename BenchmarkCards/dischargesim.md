## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and improve the discharge education capabilities of large language models in post-visit clinical education.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Patient Education
- Dialogue Generation
- Evaluation of Discharge Communication

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: MIMIC-IV dataset

**Size**: 49 discharge notes

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual generation of multiple-choice questions by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- LLM-based evaluations

**Metrics**:
