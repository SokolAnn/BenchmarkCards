**Goal**: To evaluate the graph-solving capabilities of LLMs through a collection of structured coding problems.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Graph Reasoning
- Graph Coding

**Limitations**: The dataset includes 40 coding problems and 36,900 graph samples, which is smaller compared to other LLM evaluation datasets.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated using problems sourced from LeetCode and custom problem definitions.

**Size**: 36,900 test cases

**Format**: N/A
