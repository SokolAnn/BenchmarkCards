# LocateBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LocateBench

**Overview**: LocateBench is a high-quality benchmark dedicated to evaluating the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to locate objects in an image according to natural language instructions. It consists of a multiple choice question dataset where VLMs must select the correct bounding box from four candidates based on the provided questions.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions with bounding boxes

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Pointing QA

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of LocateBench is to evaluate VLMs' ability to locate objects specified by natural language descriptions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Object Localization

**Limitations**: The benchmark focuses on multi-choice problems with only four candidates, which may not fully reflect the complexity of some real-world tasks.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed based on the RefCOCO series datasets using object descriptions from the COCO dataset.

**Size**: 1,317 examples

**Format**: multiple-choice question format

**Annotation**: Expert-annotated descriptions converted to fluent English which-questions without crowdworkers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the correct identification of the bounding box by VLMs from the provided options.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better model performance in locating objects as instructed by natural language.

**Baseline Results**: Human accuracy: 95%. GPT-4o accuracy: significantly lower than human performance.

**Validation**: Rigorous validation process involving manual inspection and correction of examples by authors.
