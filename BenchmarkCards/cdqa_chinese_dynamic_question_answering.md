# CDQA (Chinese Dynamic Question Answering)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CDQA (Chinese Dynamic Question Answering)

**Overview**: CDQA is a Chinese Dynamic QA benchmark containing question-answer pairs related to the latest news on the Chinese Internet, aimed at improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering dynamic questions.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/CDQA)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and improve the ability of Chinese LLMs to answer dynamic questions based on the latest factual knowledge.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The dataset is focused solely on the Chinese language.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Automatically generated queries from the latest Chinese news and manually labeled by crowd-sourced workers.

**Size**: 1,339 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Semi-automated with human verification and manual labeling.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Answer Rate

**Calculation**: F1-recall calculated as the ratio of common tokens between model-generated responses and ground truth; answer rate is the ratio of effectively answered questions to total questions.

**Interpretation**: A higher F1 Score indicates better model alignment with correct answers; a lower answer rate might indicate more hallucination.

**Baseline Results**: GPT-4 outperforms other models in F1-recall scores.

**Validation**: The benchmark is validated through evaluation on multiple Chinese LLMs.
