## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate fine-grained intent prediction and risk reasoning in autonomous driving scenarios involving pedestrians and cyclists.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Object Detection
- Intent Prediction
- Risk Assessment
- Action Suggestion

**Limitations**: The automated annotation pipeline may introduce errors in complex scenes with multiple VRUs.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Derived from the DRAMA dataset, which contains annotated urban driving scenarios.

**Size**: 5,686 annotated video clips spanning approximately 54,892 frames.

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated annotation via a multi-stage pipeline including tracking, motion analysis, and natural language description generation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
