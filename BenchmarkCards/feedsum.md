## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of FeedSum is to leverage LLM-generated feedback to improve text summarization by aligning summaries with human preferences regarding faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Summarization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated through LLMs using diverse input documents from 7 different domains, producing summaries with varying quality based on feedback from multiple models.

**Size**: 125,000 document-summary pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Generated feedback by LLMs on the quality of summaries.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Faithfulness
- Completeness
- Conciseness

**Calculation**: Scores are calculated based on the proportion of factual sentences, including key-facts and relevant sentence alignment in summaries.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better alignment with human preferences in summary quality; a score close to 1 signifies nearly perfect alignment.

**Validation**: Evaluated through both human assessments and automated metrics.
