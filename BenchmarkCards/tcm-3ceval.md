# TCM-3CEval

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TCM-3CEval

**Overview**: TCM-3CEval is a benchmark assessing large language models (LLMs) in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) across three dimensions: core knowledge mastery, classical text understanding, and clinical decision-making. It sets a standard for evaluating AI systems in TCM and provides insights for optimizing LLMs in culturally grounded medical domains.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/user/repo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a scientific evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals
- Academic Institutions

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The test sets are primarily derived from literature cases and require future validation through real-world clinical electronic medical records.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed high-quality exercise sets based on TCM textbooks, classical literature, and clinical cases.

**Size**: 150 questions per dataset across various dimensions, totaling 450 questions.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Reviewed and revised by TCM experts to ensure accuracy and representativeness.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Accuracy Measurement
- Comparison Against Correct Answers

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Model outputs are compared against correct answers to assess understanding and application of TCM knowledge.

**Interpretation**: Consistency in responses is considered a pass only if all outputs agree on the same correct answer.

**Baseline Results**: DeepSeek demonstrated significant advantages in key metrics: 88.59% accuracy in TCM-Exam, 71.81% accuracy in TCM-LitQA, and 78.52% accuracy in TCM-MRCD.

**Validation**: Evaluation methods designed to rigorously assess model capabilities in TCM.
