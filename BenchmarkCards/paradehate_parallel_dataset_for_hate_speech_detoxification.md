# PARADEHATE (Parallel Dataset for Hate Speech Detoxification)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: PARADEHATE (Parallel Dataset for Hate Speech Detoxification)

**Overview**: PARADEHATE is a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hate speech detoxification, consisting of over 8,000 hate/non-hate text pairs, generated through an LLM-in-the-loop methodology replacing human annotators.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ScaDS-AI/ParaDeHate)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a high-quality parallel dataset for evaluating models in the task of online hate speech detoxification.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Detoxification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Aggregated from multiple hate speech datasets including CreHate, HateXplain, Davidson, and Founta.

**Size**: 8,276 examples

**Format**: text pairs

**Annotation**: Automated generation and validation using LLMs for rephrasing, content preservation checking, and toxicity evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Style Accuracy
- Content Preservation
- Fluency
- BLEU Score

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated by comparing LLM-generated texts against original references and assessing semantic fidelity.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in detoxification tasks.

**Baseline Results**: BART fine-tuned on PARADEHATE achieves style accuracy of 0.95, content preservation of 0.78, and fluency of 0.71.

**Validation**: Dataset was validated through comparison with traditional methods and human-annotated data.
