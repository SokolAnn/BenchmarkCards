# Investigating the Role of Prompting and External Tools in Hallucination Rates of Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Investigating the Role of Prompting and External Tools in Hallucination Rates of Large Language Models

**Overview**: This paper provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of different prompting strategies and frameworks aimed at reducing hallucinations in LLMs. The findings demonstrate that the optimal prompting technique depends on the type of problem, and that simpler techniques often outperform more complex methods in reducing hallucinations.
