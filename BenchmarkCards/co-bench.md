**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real-world combinatorial optimization problems sourced from OR-Library.

**Size**: 6,482 instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated problem descriptions, data loading functions, and evaluation functions.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Agentic frameworks evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Valid Solution
- Above Classical
- Survival Rate

**Calculation**: Scores are calculated based on the normalized score of the primal bound against a pre-computed optimal objective value.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance, with a score of 1 denoting performance identical to the optimal.

**Baseline Results**: Compared with classical solvers such as Gurobi and LKH.

**Validation**: N/A
