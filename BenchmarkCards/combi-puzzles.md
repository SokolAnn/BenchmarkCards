## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the reasoning ability of established LLMs in combinatorial problems and to compare their performance with human participants.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Mathematicians
- Students

**Tasks**:
- Mathematical Reasoning

**Limitations**: The dataset contains only 125 problem variants, which may not fully capture the diversity of scenarios LLMs can encounter.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed by the authors for this study using combinatorial problems.

**Size**: 125 problem variants

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by authors

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy was calculated as the number of correct responses over the total number of problems attempted.

**Interpretation**: A higher accuracy indicates better reasoning capabilities in solving combinatorial problems.

**Validation**: Statistical significance was tested using the paired Permutation test.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data, Poor model accuracy

**Demographic Analysis**: Participants were recruited from Ukrainian pupils and undergraduates involved in STEM, with an emphasis on prior experience in combinatorial mathematics.
