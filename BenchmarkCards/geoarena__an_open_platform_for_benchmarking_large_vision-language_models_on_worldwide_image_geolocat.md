# GeoArena: An Open Platform for Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models on Worldwide Image Geolocation

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: GeoArena: An Open Platform for Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models on Worldwide Image Geolocation

**Overview**: GeoArena is the first live, user-preference-based open platform for evaluating Large Vision-Language Models on image worldwide geolocalization tasks. It collects in-the-wild images from users and uses pairwise human preference evaluations to overcome limitations of existing static benchmarks.

**Data Type**: image and text

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dynamic and user-centered evaluation framework for large vision-language models in geolocalization tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Image Geolocation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: User-submitted in-the-wild images

**Size**: 1,000 samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Collects user-uploaded images, textual instructions, model responses, and human voting outcomes.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Pairwise human preference evaluations
