## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of SVGenius is to establish a systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing capabilities and provide crucial insights for developing more capable vector graphics models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Understanding
- Editing
- Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real-world SVG data from IconFont spanning 24 application domains.

**Size**: 927 high-quality SVGs

**Format**: SVG

**Annotation**: Manually reviewed and filtered for semantic clarity.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Compression Code Ratio (CCR)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Relative Levenshtein Distance (RLD)

**Calculation**: Metrics are computed based on strict equivalence checks against ground-truth SVGs, comparing model outputs to expected results across numerous editing tasks.

**Interpretation**: High accuracy denotes successful error correction while lower error rates and higher CCR indicate effective optimization and visual fidelity.

**Baseline Results**: Detailed leaderboard results presented in tables forming comparative performance analysis across different model architectures and sizes.

**Validation**: Each task is validated through systematic testing with a diverse range of models.
