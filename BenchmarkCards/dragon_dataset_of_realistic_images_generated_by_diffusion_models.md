# DRAGON (Dataset of Realistic Images Generated by Diffusion Models)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: DRAGON (Dataset of Realistic Images Generated by Diffusion Models)

**Overview**: DRAGON is a large-scale dataset comprising 2,600,000 synthetic images generated by 25 distinct diffusion models, designed to support the forensic community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for synthetic content.

**Data Type**: image

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- N/A

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CiFAKE
- DiffusionForensics

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive dataset for training, developing, and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for images generated by diffusion models.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Forensic analysts
- Machine Learning practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Synthetic Image Detection
- Model Attribution

**Limitations**: The dataset only includes images generated by 25 open-weight diffusion models and may contain anatomical inconsistencies in human figures.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic images generated by diffusion models using prompts based on ImageNet labels.

**Size**: 2,600,000 synthetic images and 1,331,167 real images

**Format**: PNG

**Annotation**: Automatically generated based on prompts expanded through a large language model.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Multi-dimensional Preference Scoring (MPS)
- Human Preference Score (HPS)
- ImageReward (IR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on state-of-the-art scoring models to evaluate image quality.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better alignment with human preferences in image quality.

**Validation**: Performance is evaluated using the DRAGON-R subset for consistency and robustness of detection methods.
