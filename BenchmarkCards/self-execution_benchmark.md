# Self-Execution Benchmark

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Self-Execution Benchmark

**Overview**: The Self-Execution Benchmark measures a model‚Äôs ability to anticipate properties of its output, such as whether a question will be difficult for it, whether it will refuse to answer, or what kinds of associations it is likely to produce.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)
- SAD (Situational Awareness Dataset)

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/anon-researcher-2025/Self-Execution-Benchmark)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to reason about their own outputs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Self-Execution Prediction
- Associative Awareness
- Restriction Recognition
- Difficulty Assessment

**Limitations**: The evaluation is confined to a fixed set of tasks, which may not fully capture the breadth of self-executive reasoning across all potential use cases or domains.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Self-Execution Benchmark dataset

**Size**: 10,000 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually generated examples

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

**Calculation**: Accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct model predictions out of the total number of samples.

**Interpretation**: A correct response occurs when a model accurately predicts properties about its responses; a baseline of 50% guessing is used for comparison.

**Validation**: Experiments evaluated the performance of LLMs across multiple associated tasks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness
- Privacy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Fairness**: Decision bias
- **Privacy**

**Demographic Analysis**: Analysis of demographic factors was not conducted.

**Potential Harm**: The benchmark aims to avoid unintended modeling outcomes by focusing on introspective reasoning capabilities.

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: All experiments were conducted using publicly available data, with no sensitive or personally identifying information.

**Data Licensing**: Apache 2.0 License

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Not Applicable
