# vTikZ

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: vTikZ

**Overview**: The vTikZ benchmark is designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. It consists of carefully curated TikZ editing scenarios and a reviewing tool that assesses correctness based on visual feedback.

**Data Type**: code customization tasks

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate LLMs in customizing TikZ code with visual results.

**Target Audience**:
- Software Engineers
- AI Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Code Customization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset consists of 100 manually curated TikZ code customization tasks derived from various TikZ code sources.

**Size**: 100 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotations were created based on human evaluation of LLM-generated variants.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Compile Metric
