## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop an extended taxonomy of translation strategies for text simplification, making information more accessible for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in Text Simplification
- Developers of Accessibility Tools
- Educators

**Tasks**:
- Text Simplification
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Original text corpus sourced from Scottish public services, political manifestos, and newsletters.

**Size**: 76 parallel texts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated with six predefined categories representing different text simplification strategies.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Multiclass classification
- Fine-tuning transformer models
- Cross-validation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated by comparing model predictions with annotated categories in the dataset.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better predictions of necessary simplification strategies.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline model accuracy of 24.5% and a weighted F1-score of 9.6%.

**Validation**: Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation used for model evaluation.
