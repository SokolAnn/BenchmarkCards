## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Facilitate the evaluation and research of general-purpose object-level 3D understanding models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- 6D Pose Estimation
- Object Classification
- Open-Vocabulary Pose Estimation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: ImageNet21k dataset

**Size**: 86,000 objects across 200 categories

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated by a team of 30 trained annotators

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Pose Accuracy
- Classification Accuracy

**Calculation**: Pose accuracy is measured by the percentage of samples with pose errors smaller than a pre-defined threshold.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in 3D awareness and classification.

**Baseline Results**: Results demonstrate the potential of models trained on ImageNet3D compared to existing datasets.

**Validation**: Cross-validation performed on multiple model metrics.
