# LongFuncEval: Measuring the effectiveness of long context models for function calling

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LongFuncEval: Measuring the effectiveness of long context models for function calling

**Overview**: This paper investigates the long context understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in tool calling scenarios, identifying three key challenges: large tool catalog, long tool responses, and long multi-turn conversations. A new evaluation dataset is created to assess the models' performance on these challenges.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs
