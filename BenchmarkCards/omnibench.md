# OmniBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OmniBench

**Overview**: OmniBench is a novel benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously, categorized under omni-language models (OLMs).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/username/repo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of OmniBench is to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models' capabilities to integrate and understand visual, acoustic, and textual information.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Multimodal Reasoning
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is created from various tasks categorized under causal inference, identification, and abstract concepts, requiring integrated understanding across modalities.

**Size**: 1,142 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated through a rigorous protocol involving initial annotation, human inspection, and model inspection to ensure high-quality multimodal-dependent samples.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the ratio matched between the correct option and model response.

**Interpretation**: Accuracy is interpreted as the percentage of correct responses out of total attempts.

**Baseline Results**: Human evaluators achieved an accuracy of 63.19% which serves as a benchmark for model comparison.

**Validation**: Validation procedures include rigorous human inspections and automated quality checks.
