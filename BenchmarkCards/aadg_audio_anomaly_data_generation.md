# AADG (Audio Anomaly Data Generation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AADG (Audio Anomaly Data Generation)

**Overview**: The paper introduces AADG, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as world models to synthetically generate realistic audio data containing anomalies. This addresses the lack of diverse audio anomaly datasets, especially for real-life scenarios beyond industrial settings.

**Data Type**: audio

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03904)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a scalable tool for creating diverse and realistic audio datasets, which are essential to advance audio anomaly detection technologies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Audio Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Anomaly Detection

**Limitations**: The generated audio may sometimes sound unnatural and can be computationally intensive to detect.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic audio generated using the AADG framework.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Mean Opinion Score (MOS)
- Frechet Audio Distance (FAD)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on user scores for audio accuracy and alignment of generated audio with text prompts.

**Interpretation**: A higher Mean Opinion Score indicates better adherence to the audio description; lower Frechet Audio Distance indicates better match in audio separation tasks.

**Baseline Results**: AADG generated audio scores 0.88 on adherence to prompts, while existing models scored lower.

**Validation**: Each generated audio is verified for logical coherence and alignment with the scenario descriptions.
