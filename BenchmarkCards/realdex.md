## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Advance research and practical applications of human-like robotic dexterous grasping in real-world environments.

**Target Audience**:
- Robotics Researchers
- Robotic Engineers
- ML Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Dexterous Grasping
- Human-Robot Interaction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected using a teleoperation system with a Shadow Hand robot and multiple RGB-D cameras.

**Size**: 2.6k sequences of grasping motions, 955k frames of visual data

**Format**: Point cloud, RGB images

**Annotation**: Manually adjusted annotations for hand-object interactions and grasp poses.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automatic pose generation
- Motion synthesis

**Metrics**:
- User scores for human-likeness
- Stability measures
- Mean Per-Joint Positional Error (MPJPE)
- Average Variance Error (A VE)

**Calculation**: Comparisons made against pre-defined ground truth data for motion sequences and grasping poses.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in generating human-like grasping motions.

**Baseline Results**: Compared against methods like SAGA and GOAL.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments and real robot testing demonstrate the performance.
