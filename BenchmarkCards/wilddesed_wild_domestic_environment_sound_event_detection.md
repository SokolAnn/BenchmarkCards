## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To advance sound event detection (SED) research by providing a dataset representing complex acoustic environments in homes.

**Target Audience**:
- Research Community
- Sound Event Detection Researchers
- Machine Learning Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Sound Event Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: WildDESED dataset synthesized using LLMs and a curated selection of audio noises from AudioSet.

**Size**: 10,000 audio clips

**Format**: Audio files (WAV)

**Annotation**: Strong annotations provided for sound events.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Curriculum Learning
- Automated metrics evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Polyphonic Sound Event Detection Scores (PSDS)

**Calculation**: PSDS scores calculated based on sound event detection performance.

**Interpretation**: Higher PSDS scores indicate better SED performance under varying noise conditions.

**Validation**: The effectiveness of models was validated on noise levels using PSDS scores, with comparisons to baseline models.
