# 3D-SynthPlace

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: 3D-SynthPlace

**Overview**: 3D-SynthPlace is a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a ‘GPT synthesize, Human inspect’ pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset, containing nearly 17,000 scenes across four common room types—bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom.

**Data Type**: structured scene layouts

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- 3D-Front

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To construct a diverse dataset for indoor scene layout generation compatible with human preferences.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Indoor Scene Layout Generation
- Interactive Editing

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: 3D-Front dataset and synthetic layouts generated by Holodeck.

**Size**: over 16,000 scenes

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual filtering and correction for quality assurance.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

**Metrics**:
- FID
- Object Overlap Rate (OOR)
- GPT-4o Ratings

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on layout realism, physical plausibility, and aesthetic coherence.

**Interpretation**: Lower FID and OOR indicate better layout quality; GPT-4o ratings assess functionality and aesthetics.

**Baseline Results**: OptiScene achieves the lowest FID and OOR across all tasks compared to traditional baselines.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements in layout quality across various metrics.
