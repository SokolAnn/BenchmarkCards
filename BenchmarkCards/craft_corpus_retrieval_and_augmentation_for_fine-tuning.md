# CRAFT (Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CRAFT (Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning)

**Overview**: CRAFT is a framework for generating task-specific synthetic datasets grounded in text corpora, requiring only a small set of human-curated few-shot examples to initiate. It retrieves relevant documents and uses instruction-tuned large language models to augment them into task-specific samples for fine-tuning models across various domains.
