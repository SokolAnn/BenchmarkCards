## üíæ Data

**Source**: 74 real-world videos curated from the DA VIS dataset and 26 generated videos with 420 editing prompt pairs.

**Size**: 74 real-world videos and 26 generated videos

**Format**: video files

**Annotation**: Manual annotation with the aid of GPT-4o to generate captions and object masks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- VLM-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- FiVE-YN (Yes/No Accuracy)
- FiVE-MC (Multi-choice Accuracy)
- FiVE-‚à™ (Union Accuracy)
- FiVE-‚à© (Intersection Accuracy)
- CLIP Score
