# HELLO BENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: HELLO BENCH

**Overview**: HelloBench is a comprehensive, in-the-wild, and open-ended benchmark to evaluate Long Language Models' (LLMs) performance in generating long text. It categorizes long text generation tasks into five subtasks: open-ended QA, summarization, chat, text completion, and heuristic text generation.

**Data Type**: long text generation tasks

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
