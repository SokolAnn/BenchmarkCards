# SwarmBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SwarmBench

**Overview**: SwarmBench is a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of large language models (LLMs) acting as decentralized agents in multi-agent systems. It features five foundational coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input and communication.

**Data Type**: task performance and interaction logs
