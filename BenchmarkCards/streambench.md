# StreamBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: StreamBench

**Overview**: StreamBench is a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate the continuous improvement of LLM agents over input-feedback sequences, simulating an online learning environment where LLMs receive and act on a continuous flow of feedback.

**Data Type**: text

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate LLM agents' ability to improve themselves over input-feedback sequences in an online setting and develop effective streaming strategies for LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text-to-SQL
- Python Programming
- Tool Use
- Medical Diagnosis
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: StreamBench does not encompass all possible types of tasks or domains where LLMs can be applied and is limited to text without other modalities.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Diverse datasets including Spider, CoSQL, BIRD, DS-1000, ToolBench, DDXPlus, HotpotQA.

**Size**: 1,780 unique instances across various tasks.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Data is obtained from existing datasets with specific structures for each task.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Self-StreamICL
- MAM-StreamICL
- GrowPrompt
- MemPrompt

**Metrics**:
