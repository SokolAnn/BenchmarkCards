## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create a benchmark that evaluates the performance of long-context LLMs in scenarios relevant to meeting assistants, challenging LLMs with real-world noise and context-based questioning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Meeting transcripts from the ELITR project supplemented with manually crafted questions and ground-truth answers.

**Size**: 10 meetings in dev set, 8 meetings in test set

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Questions and answers are manually created and validated.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- LLM-based evaluation
- Human evaluation
- Crowdsourcing study

**Metrics**:
- Average score
- Correlation with human judges

**Calculation**: Scores are calculated based on the closeness of model predictions to the ground-truth answers.
