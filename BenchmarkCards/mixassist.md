## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the MIXASSIST dataset is to facilitate the development of AI systems that empower musicians by enhancing their mixing capabilities with accessible, context-aware guidance, fostering a co-creative learning environment.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Music Producers
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Conversational AI assistance in music mixing
- Instructional dialogue modeling

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data was collected from seven co-creative mixing sessions involving 12 music producers, with audio segments sourced from The Mix Evaluation Dataset.

**Size**: 431 audio-grounded conversational turns

**Format**: Audio files and structured conversational transcripts

**Annotation**: Annotators reviewed and filtered conversational turns based on their pedagogical value, retaining substantive, actionable guidance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics using LLM-as-a-judge

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- BLEU Score
- ROUGE-L

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on evaluations comparing generated AI responses and human expert advice in the context of music mixing.

**Interpretation**: A lower rank indicates better performance among models in generating relevant mixing advice.

**Baseline Results**: Qwen was found to significantly outperform other models in evaluations, being preferred in over 50% of cases.

**Validation**: The dataset was validated through both quantitative evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and qualitative assessments via user studies.
