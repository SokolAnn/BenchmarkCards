## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the spatial and physical reasoning abilities of large language models based on topology optimization tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Material Distribution Prediction
- Structural Stability Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated using McNeel Rhinoceros 8 and the Grasshopper programming environment with the Millipede plugin for topology optimization.

**Size**: 1,296 scenarios

**Format**: Structured grids and task-specific subsets

**Annotation**: Automatically generated through topology optimization simulations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Exact Match
- Score
- Normalized Score

**Metrics**:
- Exact Match
- Score
- Normalized Score

**Calculation**: Exact Match is binary based on whether the predicted output matches the ground truth. Score is the ratio of corrected errors. Normalized Score is a capped version of the Score.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better model performance in predicting material distributions.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs in a zero-shot setting.
