# TTS-Uniform (Test-Time Scaling Framework)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TTS-Uniform (Test-Time Scaling Framework)

**Overview**: TTS-Uniform is a framework designed to mitigate the selection bias of reasoning strategies in large language models (LLMs) when applying test-time scaling. It aims to enhance the effectiveness of scaling by uniformly allocating the sampling budget across diverse reasoning strategies.
