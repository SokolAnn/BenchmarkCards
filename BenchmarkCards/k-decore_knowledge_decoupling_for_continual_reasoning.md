## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To propose a continual framework for structured knowledge reasoning that facilitates knowledge transfer across diverse tasks while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Structured Knowledge Reasoning

**Limitations**: Due to time and cost constraints, reasoning-based LLMs (like QWQ 32B) were not employed as the backbone for the framework.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Four structured knowledge reasoning benchmarks curated for experimental tasks.

**Size**: 4 datasets

**Format**: Various formats depending on the dataset (e.g., JSON, SQL queries for DB reasoning, SPARQL queries for KG reasoning)

**Annotation**: The data has been extracted from structured knowledge benchmarks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation against existing continual learning methods and baselines

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- BWT (Backward Transfer)
- FWT (Forward Transfer)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the accuracy scores from various tasks before and after training.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance while lower forgetting rates (BWT) and higher knowledge transfer (FWT) suggest more effective continual learning.

**Baseline Results**: K-DECORE shows superior performance compared to multiple state-of-the-art continual learning methods.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments conducted over multiple metrics across different structured knowledge reasoning tasks.
