## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of ToolHop is to evaluate large language models in their ability to use tools effectively in multi-hop scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Multi-Hop Reasoning

**Limitations**: The dataset primarily focuses on multi-hop tool use and may not extensively cover simple tool invocation tasks.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed using a query-driven data construction approach based on the MoreHopQA dataset.

**Size**: 995 queries and 3,912 tools

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Invocation Error

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the proportion of correct answers and invocation errors through comparison with predefined answers.

**Interpretation**: An accuracy score of 100% indicates perfect model performance, while higher invocation errors suggest greater difficulty in tool use.

**Validation**: The benchmark was validated through comprehensive evaluations of multiple model families.
