# Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)

**Overview**: ELK aims to find patterns in a neural network's activations that robustly track the true state of the world, introducing 12 datasets and corresponding quirky language models finetuned to make systematic errors in context-dependent scenarios.

**Data Type**: binary classification datasets

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EleutherAI/elk-generalization)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a methodology for eliciting reliable knowledge from language models that output untruthful information.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Binary Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 12 binary classification datasets designed to evaluate the performance of ELK methods.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Logistic Regression
- Difference-in-Means
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Contrast Consistent Search
- Contrastive Representation Clustering
- Logistic Regression on Contrast Pairs
- Difference-in-Means on Contrast Pairs

**Metrics**:
- Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)

**Calculation**: Probing methods are evaluated based on their ability to classify examples as true or false accurately in the context of the ELK framework.

**Interpretation**: Higher AUROC indicates better generalization of probes to track truthful knowledge in the presence of untruthful outputs from language models.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The model's performance is tested for its ability to recover knowledge representations in contexts where the language model produces untruthful outputs.
