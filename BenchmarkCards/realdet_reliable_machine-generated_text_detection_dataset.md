## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive dataset for machine-generated text detection research that ensures realistic calibration and enhances the performance of detection frameworks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: RealDet dataset may still exhibit some inherent biases due to the nature of the sources it encompasses.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from 15 representative data sources across various writing tasks including question answering, news writing, and academic writing.

**Size**: 847,909 texts

**Format**: Raw text files

**Annotation**: Generated from a mix of human-written and machine-generated sources, ensuring diversity and domain coverage.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- False Positive Rate (FPR)
- True Positive Rate (TPR)
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated by comparing the predictions of detectors on the test datasets against the known labels of the texts.

**Interpretation**: High TPR and low FPR are desired to indicate effective detection performance.

**Validation**: Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MCP framework effectively constrains FPRs and improves detection performance.
