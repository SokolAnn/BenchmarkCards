## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To comprehensively investigate the behavior of MLLMs in continual instruction tuning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Image Classification
- Grounding

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Diverse publicly available vision-language datasets like VQAv2, ScienceQA, and ImageNet.

**Size**: 10 datasets spanning 8 tasks

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated using scripts for instruction tuning.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- LLM-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Mean Average Accuracy (MAA)
- Backward Transfer (BWT)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the outputs of MLLMs in comparison to ground truths and also evaluated for reasoning capabilities.

**Interpretation**: High MAA indicates consistent performance, while lower BWT reflects catastrophic forgetting.

**Validation**: Continual evaluation of MLLMs through diverse tasks and structured instructions.
