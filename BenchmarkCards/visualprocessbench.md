- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Error Detection in Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data collected from multimodal reasoning benchmarks including MMMU, MathVision, MathVerse, and others; annotated by human experts.

**Size**: 2,866 samples with 26,950 step-wise correctness labels

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by experts with at least a university degree.
