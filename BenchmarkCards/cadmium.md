# CADmium

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CADmium

**Overview**: CADmium introduces a large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated by a pipeline based on GPT-4.1, aimed at automating the CAD design process.

**Data Type**: CAD models with natural language descriptions

**Domains**:
- Computer-Aided Design

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- DeepCAD
- Text2CAD

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To automate the CAD design process using large language models for text-conditioned generation of CAD sequences.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text-to-CAD Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: DeepCAD dataset (176,017 CAD models) and annotations generated via a GPT-4.1-based pipeline

**Size**: 170,000+ CAD models

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Generated using a multimodal approach with human-like fluency and geometric precision.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Supervised fine-tuning of Qwen-2.5 Coder
- Evaluation using geometric and topological metrics

**Metrics**:
- Sphericity Discrepancy (SD)
- Discrete Mean Curvature Difference (DMCD)
- Exact Euler Characteristic Match (EECM)

**Calculation**: Metrics such as SD, DMCD, and EECM are calculated based on geometric properties of the generated CAD models compared to the ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Lower values in SD, DMCD, and higher values in EECM indicate better similarity to ground truth CAD models.

**Baseline Results**: Compared against state-of-the-art CAD generation models, including Text2CAD.

**Validation**: Cross-validation on both CADmium and Text2CAD datasets.
