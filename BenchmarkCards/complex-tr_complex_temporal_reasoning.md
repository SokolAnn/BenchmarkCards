# Complex-TR (Complex Temporal Reasoning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Complex-TR (Complex Temporal Reasoning)

**Overview**: The Complex-TR dataset focuses on multi-answer and multi-hop temporal reasoning, addressing the shortcomings of existing temporal QA datasets that primarily evaluated one-hop questions and used inappropriate metrics for multi-answer assessments.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- TempReason
- TimeQA
- TempLAMA

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nusnlp/complex-tr)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for multi-hop and multi-answer temporal reasoning in question-answering systems.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The dataset may contain factual errors existing in the Wikidata knowledge base.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from the Wikidata knowledge base and verified using human annotators.

**Size**: 10,800 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually verified by college-educated annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Data augmentation
- Context refinement

**Metrics**:
- Set-level accuracy
- Answer-level F1

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the strict criteria of matching the entire set of answers.

**Interpretation**: Higher set accuracy indicates better performance on multi-answer questions; lower answer F1 scores indicate the model's struggle to retrieve all correct answers.

**Validation**: Human verification of the QA pairs and contexts.
