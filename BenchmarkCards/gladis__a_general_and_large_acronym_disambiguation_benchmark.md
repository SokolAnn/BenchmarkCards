# GLADIS: A General and Large Acronym Disambiguation Benchmark

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: GLADIS: A General and Large Acronym Disambiguation Benchmark

**Overview**: To accelerate the research on acronym disambiguation, we construct a new benchmark named GLADIS with three components: (1) a much larger acronym dictionary with 1.5M acronyms and 6.4M long forms; (2) a pre-training corpus with 160 million sentences; (3) three datasets that cover the general, scientific, and biomedical domains.

**Data Type**: text (sentences with acronyms and acronym-long form pairs)

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Scientific Research
- Biomedical

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- SciAD
- MadDog
- UAD
- WikilinksNED Unseen Mentions
- Medmentions

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Construct GLADIS, a General and Large Acronym DISambiguation benchmark that includes a larger dictionary, a pre-training corpus and three datasets covering the general, scientific, and biomedical domains to accelerate research on acronym disambiguation.

**Target Audience**:
- Research community
- NLP Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Acronym Disambiguation

**Limitations**: The acronym dictionary still contains a small fraction of duplicate/noisy long forms due to typos, morphological changes and nested acronyms (manual evaluation shows 6% noisy long forms in a random sample; frequency-weighted clean forms = 97%). Performance on the Scientific subset still needs improvement and may require more domain-specific pre-training data.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Pile dataset (Gao et al., 2020) textual sources; Wikidata Alias Table; UMLS Concept Names; adapted datasets: WikilinksNED Unseen Mentions, Medmentions, SciAD. Sources listed in Table 2 of the paper.

**Size**: Dictionary: 1.5M acronyms and 6.4M long forms; Pre-training corpus: ~160 million sentences; Source corpora total: 838.14 GiB (as shown in Table 2); Datasets: General ~45,000 samples, Scientific ~56,000 samples, Biomedical ~12,000 samples.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Dictionary extracted via rule-based algorithm (Schwartz and Hearst, 2002). Datasets: adapted from human-annotated and crowd-sourced entity disambiguation datasets (Medmentions: professional annotators; SciAD: human-annotated; WikilinksNED Unseen Mentions: crowd-sourced).

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Unsupervised evaluation (no access to train/validation sets)
- Fine-tuned evaluation (models fine-tuned on train sets using triplet loss)
- Pre-training AcroBERT with triplet loss and ambiguous negatives

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- Macro F1 (Averaged F1 across classes)
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Macro F1 is computed as the Averaged F1 across classes: compute F1 for each class and average them (the paper uses Averaged F1 to avoid overweighting popular classes). Precision and Recall definitions follow standard class-wise definitions; details in Appendix A.5.

**Interpretation**: Higher Macro F1 (Averaged F1) and Accuracy indicate better acronym disambiguation. The Averaged F1 is preferred to avoid bias toward popular classes, per the paper.

**Baseline Results**: Unsupervised setting (average across General, Scientific, Biomedical): AcroBERT Avg Macro F1 = 53.1, Avg Accuracy = 57.0 (Table 5). Fine-tuned setting (average): AcroBERT Avg Macro F1 = 54.1, Avg Accuracy = 57.7 (Table 6). Baselines reported include BM25, FastText, MadDog, BERT, BioBERT, SciBERT, and a Popularity-Ours baseline; detailed per-domain results are in Tables 5 and 6.

**Validation**: Datasets are repartitioned with a 6:2:2 ratio ensuring acronyms in the training set do not appear in validation and test sets (to avoid leakage). Manual checks: a random sample of 100 extracted sentences yielded 94% precision for acronym extraction; manual evaluation of 100 randomly chosen long forms from datasets shows 6% noisy long forms (frequency-weighted clean forms = 97%). SciAD was re-split to avoid data leakage.
