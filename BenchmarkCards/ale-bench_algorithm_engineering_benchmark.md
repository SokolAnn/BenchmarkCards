## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Public evaluation
- Private evaluation
- Iterative refinement testing

**Metrics**:
- Average Performance
- Performance Distribution
- AtCoder Rating

**Calculation**: Performance metrics are calculated based on aggregate scoring from individual problem evaluations, utilizing normalization and ranking methods similar to those used in human contests.

**Interpretation**: Higher performance scores indicate better algorithm engineering capabilities as evaluated against human contestants.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The ALE-Bench results are compared directly against human performance metrics established in previous AHC contests.
