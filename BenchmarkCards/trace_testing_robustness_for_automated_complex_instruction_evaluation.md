# TRACE (Testing Robustness for Automated Complex instruction Evaluation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TRACE (Testing Robustness for Automated Complex instruction Evaluation)

**Overview**: TRACE is a benchmark for enhancing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions, consisting of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data.

**Data Type**: complex instruction pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CFBench
- IFEval
- INFOBENCH

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/IOPO)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve and evaluate the capability of LLMs to follow complex instructions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Instruction Following

**Limitations**: The evaluation set has undergone strict manual verification, but the training set has not.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Automatically constructed from manually sorted taxonomy of complex instructions with 26 constraint dimensions within 5 constraint types.

**Size**: 120,000 training examples and 1,042 evaluation examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Generated using an automated data construction workflow and manually verified for evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Instruction Following Score

**Calculation**: The overall instruction following score (I) is calculated based on adherence to constraints in the evaluation.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better adherence to the specific constraints outlined in complex instructions.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments on various datasets confirmed the effectiveness of TRACE.
