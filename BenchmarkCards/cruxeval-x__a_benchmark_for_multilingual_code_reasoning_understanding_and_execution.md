## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark that evaluates the reasoning capabilities of large language models across different programming languages.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Academics

**Tasks**:
- Input Reasoning
- Output Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed using an automated pipeline that includes code translation and generation steps

**Size**: 19,000 reasoning pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated from existing code examples with iterative repairs based on execution feedback

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Pass@1

**Calculation**: Pass@1 accuracy is calculated based on the proportion of correctly answered test cases among total cases.

**Interpretation**: A higher Pass@1 indicates a better reasoning capability of the evaluated model.

**Baseline Results**: Results based on 24 mainstream LLMs tested against the benchmark.

**Validation**: N/A
