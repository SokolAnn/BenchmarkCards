# DigestDS

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: DigestDS

**Overview**: DigestDS is a novel dataset comprised of practical medical records from experienced experts in digestive system diseases, created to address the scarcity of high-quality clinical datasets for predicting Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescriptions.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop a high-quality prescription dataset for predicting herbal prescriptions in Traditional Chinese Medicine using large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals

**Tasks**:
- Prescription Prediction
- Dosage Prediction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Clinical medical records collected from TCM specialists in digestive system disorders.

**Size**: 16,896 samples for training, 2,057 samples for testing

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Data was cleaned and filtered for essential information by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Supervised fine-tuning
- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)

**Metrics**:
