**Name**: AGIBench: A Multi-granularity, Multimodal, Human-referenced, Auto-scoring Benchmark for Large Language Models

**Overview**: AGIBench is a multi-granularity, multimodal, human-referenced, and auto-scoring benchmarking methodology for evaluating large language models (LLMs), focusing on diverse question types and difficulty levels.

**Data Type**: multimodal question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- GLUE
- SuperGLUE
- BIG-Bench
- HELM

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the question-solving abilities and intelligence of LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Questions are primarily sourced from national civil service examinations.

**Size**: 927 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Questions are labeled with a four-tuple <ability branch, knowledge, difficulty, modal>.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Auto-scoring methodology
- Heuristic regular expression searching

**Metrics**:
- Average accuracy
- Worst-case accuracy
