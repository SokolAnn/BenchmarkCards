# COM2 (COM plex COM monsense)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: COM2 (COM plex COM monsense)

**Overview**: COM2 is a complex commonsense reasoning dataset created by sampling multi-hop logical queries from an existing commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) and verbalizing them into multiple-choice and text generation questions.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tqfang/complex-commonsense-reasoning)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark for evaluating complex commonsense reasoning abilities of language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: Issues with data quality and sparsity affecting query construction.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Sampled logical queries from the ATOMIC commonsense knowledge graph

**Size**: 790,000 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually validated by crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk

## üî¨ Methodology
