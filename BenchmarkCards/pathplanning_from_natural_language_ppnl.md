## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To analyze the ability of LLMs to perform spatial-temporal reasoning through path planning tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- AI Researchers
- Robotics Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Path Planning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic grid environments generated for path planning tasks.

**Size**: 160,000 task instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
