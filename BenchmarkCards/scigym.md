## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate large language models' capabilities in conducting scientific experiments and analysis in a simulated biological context.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Biologists
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Experiment Design
- Data Analysis

**Limitations**: Performance of models declines significantly with increasing system complexity.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 350 SBML models curated from BioModels database

**Size**: 350 models

**Format**: SBML

**Annotation**: Curated and filtered to remove unusable models

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation of LLMs through simulated experiments
- Performance comparison among models

**Metrics**:
- Simulation Trajectory Error (STE)
- Reaction Matching Score (RMS)
- Network Topology Score (NTS)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the similarity between predicted and actual biological models.

**Interpretation**: Lower STE and higher RMS/NTS indicate better performance in recovering the underlying biological mechanisms.

**Baseline Results**: Performance comparisons were made against zero-shot prompting results of the models.

**Validation**: Validated through experimental simulations and comprehensive performance metrics.
