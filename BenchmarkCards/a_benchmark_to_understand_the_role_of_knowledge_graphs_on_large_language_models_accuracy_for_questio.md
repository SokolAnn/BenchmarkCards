## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To understand the accuracy of LLM-powered question answering systems with respect to enterprise questions and the role knowledge graphs play in improving accuracy.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Enterprise Data Analysts
- Business Intelligence Professionals

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The benchmark utilizes the OMG Property and Casualty Data Model database schema and includes a set of enterprise natural language questions.

**Size**: 43 questions

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Questions are mapped to expected SQL queries and evaluated based on execution accuracy.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Zero-shot prompting

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Overall Execution Accuracy (OEA)
- Average Overall Execution Accuracy (AOEA)

**Calculation**: Execution Accuracy is calculated by comparing the output of generated SQL queries against reference SQL queries.

**Interpretation**: A higher OEA signifies a more accurate question answering system capable of matching expected outputs.

**Baseline Results**: GPT-4 achieved an AOEA of 16.7% for SQL and 54.2% for SPARQL over Knowledge Graph.

**Validation**: Results validated by performing numerous executions of queries against sample data.
