# MEMO-Bench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MEMO-Bench

**Overview**: MEMO-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the emotional analysis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It consists of 7,145 portraits representing six different emotions, generated by T2I models, and offers a framework for sentiment analysis, focusing on both generation capabilities and comprehension assessment.

**Data Type**: emotionally generated portrait images

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- N/A

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- C-Eval
- AGI-Eval
- MMLU
- CMMLU

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the sentiment analysis capabilities of Text-to-Image models and Multimodal Large Language Models.

**Target Audience**:
- Research community
- AI developers

**Tasks**:
- Emotion Generation
- Emotion Comprehension

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated by 12 Text-to-Image models

**Size**: 7,145 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually reviewed for sentiment category, intensity, and image quality by 29 volunteers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Mean Opinion Scores (MOS)

**Calculation**: GACC (Emotion Generation Accuracy) and GERR (Generation Error Rate) are used for evaluating T2I models.

**Interpretation**: High scores indicate effective emotional generation; however, existing models are noted to perform better on positive emotions than negative ones.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Progressive evaluation from coarse-grained to fine-grained metrics for assessing sentiment comprehension.
