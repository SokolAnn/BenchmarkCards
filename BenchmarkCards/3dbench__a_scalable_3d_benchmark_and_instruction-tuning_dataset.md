## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: 3DBench: A Scalable 3D Benchmark and Instruction-Tuning Dataset

**Overview**: 3DBench is a scalable benchmark designed for evaluating 3D-LLMs covering ten diverse multi-modal tasks with three types of evaluation metrics.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a scalable evaluation benchmark specifically designed for assessing 3D-LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Visual Grounding
- Detection
- Counting
- Room Detection
- Pose Relationship
- Object Relationship
- Navigation
- Question Answering
- Caption Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated using the Procthor simulation framework and includes data collected from 30,000 houses.

**Size**: over 0.23 million QA pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Ground-truth is incorporated into diverse dialogue templates.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
