# MobIE: A German Dataset for Named Entity Recognition, Entity Linking and Relation Extraction in the Mobility Domain

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MobIE: A German Dataset for Named Entity Recognition, Entity Linking and Relation Extraction in the Mobility Domain

**Overview**: MobIE is a German-language dataset that combines annotations for Named Entity Recognition (NER), Entity Linking (EL), and Relation Extraction (RE) specifically in the context of mobility-related events such as traffic obstructions and public transport issues.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- German

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the MobIE dataset is to facilitate joint and multi-task learning of fundamental information extraction tasks in the mobility domain, specifically for NER, EL, and RE.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Named Entity Recognition
- Entity Linking
- Relation Extraction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is collected from German Twitter messages and RSS feeds related to mobility events.

**Size**: 3,232 documents

**Format**: AVRO, JSONL

**Annotation**: Human-annotated with experts validating the labels and weakly-supervised annotations generated using the Snorkel framework.
