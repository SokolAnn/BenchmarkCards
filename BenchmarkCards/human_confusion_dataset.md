# Human Confusion Dataset

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Human Confusion Dataset

**Overview**: The Human Confusion Dataset is introduced to study dual thinking and logical processing in human vision, providing a range of confusing images that reveal insights into the dual processing framework in human visual perception.

**Data Type**: images

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- N/A

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMMU

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for analyzing human visual processing and evaluating deep learning models on cognitively challenging images.

**Target Audience**:
- Cognitive Scientists
- AI Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Visual Reasoning
- Segmentation

**Limitations**: The dataset requires models to rely on cues that are not commonly encountered, requiring specific solutions tailored to their respective environments.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Crowd-sourced using Amazon Turk and contributions from additional participants.

**Size**: 1,000 images
