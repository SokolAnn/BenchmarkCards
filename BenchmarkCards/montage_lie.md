# MONTAGE LIE

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MONTAGE LIE

**Overview**: MONTAGE LIE is a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of information alignment evaluators to detect misleading narratives composed of reordered but truthful statements, revealing limitations in existing evaluators.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- FEVER
- FEVEROUS
- LLM-AggreFact

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the robustness of various evaluators in identifying misleading narratives that contain accurately stated facts but distort causality through reordering.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: The MONTAGE LIE benchmark is entirely generated by large language models and may not reflect real-world human-written misinformation. It currently only covers English.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Publicly available long-form summarization datasets.

**Size**: 1,303 instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated using large language models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- AUC-ROC

**Metrics**:
- AUC-ROC

**Calculation**: The AUC-ROC score quantifies the evaluator's ability to distinguish correct target texts from deceptive alternatives across varying levels of difficulty.

**Interpretation**: Higher AUC-ROC indicates better evaluator performance in distinguishing true from deceptive narratives.

**Baseline Results**: Existing evaluators struggle with average AUC-ROC scores below 65%.

**Validation**: Data quality verified through human evaluation with good agreement scores.
