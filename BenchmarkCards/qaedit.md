# QAEdit

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: QAEdit

**Overview**: QAEdit is a benchmark tailored for real-world QA tasks, designed to assess model editing in large language models (LLMs) and to expose limitations in synthetic evaluation practices.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ZsRE
- COUNTER FACT

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To rigorously assess model editing methods in real-world question answering scenarios and to expose pitfalls of synthetic evaluation methods.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from three widely-used QA datasets: Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and SimpleQA.

**Size**: 19,249 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Extracted subjects from the questions using GPT-4, paraphrased prompts, and selected unrelated QA pairs for locality evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Calculated based on the success rate of edited LLMs on previously failed questions in QA tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance of the editing methods in real-world QA settings.

**Baseline Results**: Average accuracy of existing editing methods was found to be significantly lower than previously reported results under synthetic evaluations.

**Validation**: N/A

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
