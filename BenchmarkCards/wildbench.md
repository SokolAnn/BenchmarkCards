## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a realistic, dynamic, contamination-resilient evaluation framework that accurately reflects the capabilities of LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Coding & Debugging
- Creative Writing
- Data Analysis
- Information Seeking
- Reasoning
- Planning
- Editing

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Sourced from the WildChat dataset, which includes one million human-chatbot conversations.

**Size**: 1,024 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Curated through a multi-step process including manual review and difficulty annotation by multiple LLMs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- WB-Score
- WB-Reward

**Calculation**: WB-Score evaluates each model's output individually and WB-Reward uses pairwise comparisons between model outputs.

**Interpretation**: Scores closer to 10 indicate a better performance, while scores below 5 indicate various levels of issues with the response.

**Baseline Results**: Three baseline models (GPT-4-Turbo, Claude-3-Haiku, Llama-2-70B-chat) are used for comprehensive evaluation.

**Validation**: The evaluation process includes structured checklists to ensure consistent and reliable judgments.
