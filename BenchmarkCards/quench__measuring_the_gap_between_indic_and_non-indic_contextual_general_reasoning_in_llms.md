## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: QUENCH: Measuring the gap between Indic and Non-Indic Contextual General Reasoning in LLMs

**Overview**: QUENCH is a novel text-based English Quizzing Benchmark manually curated from YouTube quiz videos that assesses world knowledge and deduction capabilities of large language models (LLMs) via a zero-shot, open-domain quizzing setup.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMLU
- SuperGLUE

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the deductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs using a novel quiz trivia dataset.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Entity Prediction
- Rationale Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Manually annotated YouTube quiz videos.

**Size**: 400 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by expert annotators

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation with zero-shot prompting
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score
