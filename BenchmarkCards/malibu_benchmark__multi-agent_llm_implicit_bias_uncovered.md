# MALIBU Benchmark: Multi-Agent LLM Implicit Bias Uncovered

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MALIBU Benchmark: Multi-Agent LLM Implicit Bias Uncovered

**Overview**: MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems through scenario-based assessments, quantifying biases in LLM-generated outputs and emphasizing the need for nuanced detection and balanced fairness strategies.

**Data Type**: scenario-based evaluations

**Domains**:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Ethics in AI

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MALIBU-Benchmark-228Covert)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social biases and stereotypes.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Ethicists
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Bias Measurement
- Evaluation of Multi-Agent Systems

**Limitations**: This study faces constraints that may affect the generalization of findings, such as a narrow range of models tested and a focus on a few socio-demographic groups.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated scenarios and responses using LLMs.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Responses evaluated by judges labeled with specific demographic personas.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Scenario-based evaluation
- Multi-agent interaction framework

**Metrics**:
- Creativity
- Accuracy
- Efficiency
- Reliability

**Calculation**: Scores are calculated based on independent evaluations for single candidates and comparative evaluations for pairs.

**Interpretation**: Scores reflect the presence of implicit biases across demographic identities based on varying evaluations.

**Baseline Results**: Biases identified across various demographic groups; variations confirmed statistically significant.

**Validation**: Evaluated through multi-agent discussions and standardized scoring procedures.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Fairness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data

**Demographic Analysis**: A diverse set of demographic identities was tested for systemic biases.
