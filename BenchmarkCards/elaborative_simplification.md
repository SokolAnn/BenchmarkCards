# Elaborative simplification

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Elaborative simplification

**Overview**: This paper presents the first data-driven study of elaborative simplification, involving the insertion of content to make simplified text easier to understand. It introduces a new annotated dataset of 1.3K instances of elaborative simplification in the Newsela corpus and establishes baselines for elaboration generation.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nehasrikn/elaborative-simplification)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide resources and directions toward understanding and generating naturally occurring elaborations, thereby improving text simplification.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Educators
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Simplification
- Natural Language Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Newsela corpus

**Size**: 1,300 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human annotation with verification of candidate elaborations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score

**Calculation**: BLEU scores are computed for the generated elaborations against the gold standard.

**Interpretation**: High BLEU scores indicate better lexical overlap with the gold elaborations.

**Baseline Results**: The best models achieved BLEU-1 scores of 20.9 in elaboration generation tasks.

**Validation**: The validation set consisted of expert-annotated instances.
