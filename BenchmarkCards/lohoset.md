# LoHoSet

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LoHoSet

**Overview**: LoHoSet is designed for training the LoHoVLA model on long-horizon embodied tasks and consists of 20 long-horizon tasks with 1,000 expert demonstrations each, featuring visual observations, linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions.

**Data Type**: visual observations, linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions

**Domains**:
- Robotics

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- LoHoRavens

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for training and evaluating a unified vision-language-action model for long-horizon embodied tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Robotics Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Long-Horizon Task Planning

**Limitations**: The precision of robot actions may be limited due to the discrete nature of commands.

## üíæ Data
