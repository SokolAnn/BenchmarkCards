# MRScore (Metric for Radiology Report Generation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MRScore (Metric for Radiology Report Generation)

**Overview**: This paper introduces MRScore, an automatic evaluation metric tailored for radiology report generation, which enhances alignment with human evaluation standards by leveraging large language models to autonomously generate evaluation samples.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a more accurate and cost-effective evaluation for automated radiology report generation by aligning model outputs with human assessments.

**Target Audience**:
- Medical Researchers
- Radiologists
- AI Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated by GPT-4 based on ground truth reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

**Size**: 2,994 reports

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated evaluation scores paired from human evaluations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

**Metrics**:
- Kendall's Tau
- Spearman's Rank Correlation

**Calculation**: MRScore is calculated based on paired reports comprising accepted and rejected samples.

**Interpretation**: Higher MRScore indicates better alignment with human evaluations of report quality.

**Baseline Results**: MRScore achieved a Kendall correlation of 0.250 and Spearman correlation of 0.304 with human judgments.

**Validation**: Validated using correlations between MRScore and human evaluations on a dataset of generated reports.
