# TransBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TransBench

**Overview**: TransBench is introduced as a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating machine translation models in industrial applications, targeting domains such as international e-commerce with 17,000 professionally translated sentences across 33 language pairs. It aims to assess models on three levels: Basic Linguistic Competence, Domain-Specific Proficiency, and Cultural Adaptation, addressing the evaluation needs that existing benchmarks do not meet.
