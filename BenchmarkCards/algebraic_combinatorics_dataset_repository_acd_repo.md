# Algebraic Combinatorics Dataset Repository (ACD Repo)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Algebraic Combinatorics Dataset Repository (ACD Repo)

**Overview**: The ACD Repo consists of a collection of 9 datasets representing foundational results or open problems in algebraic combinatorics, designed to support the conjecturing process in mathematics. Each dataset includes an open-ended question and a large collection of examples from which conjectures should be generated.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Mathematics

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pnnl/ML4AlgComb)
