## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing efficiency techniques in large language models (LLMs) across various dimensions including architecture pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference optimization.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation
- Visual Question Answering
- Image Captioning

**Limitations**: The benchmark does not encompass all existing efficiency techniques, particularly those relating to memory optimization during long sequence processing.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Empirical study involving over 100 model-technique pairs executed on a production-class GPU cluster.

**Size**: 350B tokens (FineWeb-Edu dataset) and various model parameters ranging from 1.5B to 72B.

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
- Bit-Width Quantization
- Model Compression Techniques

**Metrics**:
- Average Memory Utilization (AMU)
- Peak Compute Utilization (PCU)
- Average Latency (AL)
- Tokens Throughput (TT)
- Average Energy Consumption (AEC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on empirical studies using defined datasets and benchmarks to measure efficiency across computed resources.

**Interpretation**: Higher values in throughput and lower values in latency and energy consumption indicate better model efficiency.

**Baseline Results**: Performance compared against standard benchmarks like MMLU-Pro and BBH.

**Validation**: Extensive empirical studies conducted on modern GPU clusters validating the efficiency trade-offs.
