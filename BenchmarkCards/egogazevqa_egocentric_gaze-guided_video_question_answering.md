## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess whether MLLMs can utilize egocentric gaze signals for analyzing daily-routine videos.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from egocentric video clips sourced from Ego4D, EgoExo4D, and EGTEA Gaze+ with gaze tracking data.

**Size**: 913 videos with 1757 QA pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Generated using MLLMs and refined by human annotators for relevance, answerability, fluency, accuracy, conciseness, and difficulty.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: The performance is assessed by comparing model predictions to ground truth labels.

**Interpretation**: A higher accuracy percentage indicates better performance in understanding user intentions.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline performance of various MLLMs on EgoGazeVQA includes a maximum accuracy of 60.5% for Qwen2.5-VL-72B.

**Validation**: Models were evaluated on their ability to leverage gaze information in question-answering tasks.
