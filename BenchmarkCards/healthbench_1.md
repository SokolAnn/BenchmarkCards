## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate large language models on their ability to generate high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions in real-world contexts.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Clinical Decision Support
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset consists of clinician-validated interactions that include various patient queries and model responses evaluated by expert rubric criteria.

**Size**: 5,000 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Expert annotation by physicians using a rubric-based framework.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Rubric-based evaluation
- Performance scoring

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
