# NUTSHELL

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: NUTSHELL

**Overview**: NUTSHELL is a novel multimodal dataset for Speech-to-Abstract Generation (SAG) from *ACL conference talks, containing recorded presentations paired with their corresponding abstracts to facilitate the generation of abstracts from spoken content.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- SCISUMMNET

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Advance research in Speech-to-Abstract Generation (SAG) and foster the development of improved models and evaluation methods.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Summarization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Recorded presentations from *ACL conferences (2017-2022) paired with their abstracts.

**Size**: 6,316 presentations, 1,172 hours of audio

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human evaluations for quality assessment and model evaluations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automatic metrics

**Metrics**:
- ROUGE
- BERTScore

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on n-gram overlap and contextualized token embeddings between summaries and references.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in generating concise and accurate abstracts.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Models were evaluated based on both automatic metrics and human judgments to ensure reliability.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
