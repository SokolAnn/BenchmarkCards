**Name**: HOAXPEDIA

**Overview**: HOAXPEDIA is a collection of 311 hoax articles alongside semantically similar legitimate articles, aimed at fostering research in automated hoax detection.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Wiki-Reliability

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hsuvaskakoty/hoaxpedia)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hsuvas/hoaxpedia_dataset.git)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for the binary classification task of detecting hoax articles in Wikipedia.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: The dataset is small, with only 311 hoax examples, which limits robust training scenarios.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: HOAXPEDIA dataset is constructed from existing literature and official Wikipedia lists of hoaxes.
