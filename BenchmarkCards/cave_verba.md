# Cave Verba

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Cave Verba

**Overview**: The paper presents a methodology to evaluate the lexical diversity of text generated by conversational LLMs, specifically using ChatGPT as a case study. This involves designing a dataset aimed at exploring how lexical diversity varies with different model parameters and roles assigned to the model.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11121394)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and understand the lexical diversity of LLM-generated text and how it depends on model parameters and roles assigned to conversational models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Linguistic Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A dataset designed to exercise text generation by conversational LLMs, collected from various prompts across different tasks and roles.

**Size**: 500 prompts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Root Type-Token Ratio (RTTR)
- Maas metric
- Moving Average TTR (MATTR)
- Measure of Lexical Diversity (MTLD)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the total number of words and distinct words generated by LLMs for each category and averaged metrics per task.

**Interpretation**: Higher values of metrics indicate greater lexical diversity in the generated text.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Results validated through statistical comparison of outputs across different LLM configurations.
