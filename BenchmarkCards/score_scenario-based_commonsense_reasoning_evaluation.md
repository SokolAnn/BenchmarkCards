# SCoRE (Scenario-based Commonsense Reasoning Evaluation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SCoRE (Scenario-based Commonsense Reasoning Evaluation)

**Overview**: SCoRE is a benchmark designed to evaluate complex logical reasoning in commonsense scenarios through multi-step inference chains, synthesizing 100,000 bilingual (Chinese‚ÄìEnglish) questions of varying difficulty levels and explicit reasoning chains.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the long-chain commonsense reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and diagnose their reasoning capabilities.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Complex Logical Reasoning
- Multi-step Inference

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The data is generated from a knowledge-based approach combining manual construction of a reliable knowledge base and automatic question generation.

**Size**: 100,000 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually constructed knowledge base integrated with automated question generation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the proportion of correct answers among the total presented questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better commonsense reasoning performance.

**Baseline Results**: The highest-performing model achieved 69.78% accuracy on SCoRE.

**Validation**: Evaluated against 13 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs.
