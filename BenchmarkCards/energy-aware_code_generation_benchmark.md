## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the efficiency and sustainability of Small Language Models (SLMs) in comparison to Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- Academic Researchers
- Software Developers
- Environmental Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Performance Evaluation

**Limitations**: The findings may not apply to all LLMs, especially those using newer architectures or trained on different datasets.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 150 coding problems randomly selected from LeetCode, categorized by difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.

**Size**: 150 problems

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Statistical evaluation
- Energy consumption measurement
- Runtime and memory usage analysis

**Metrics**:
- Correctness
- Runtime
- Memory usage
- Energy consumption

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on execution of generated code in a controlled environment using Python scripts.

**Interpretation**: Lower execution time and energy consumption indicate better efficiency. Higher correctness signals more effective code generation.

**Baseline Results**: Human-written solutions are used as the baseline for correctness and efficiency.

**Validation**: Each generated solution is tested against community-verified solutions to assess correctness.
