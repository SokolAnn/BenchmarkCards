## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to systematically evaluate the role of traditional algorithmic guidance in enhancing the pathfinding capabilities of LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Path Planning
- Route Optimization

**Limitations**: Performance of LLMs on ultra-large-scale maps remains unclear and requires extended experiments to assess trade-offs.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Randomly generated N×N grid environments with non-overlapping obstacles.

**Size**: Various sizes with complexity: N=10 (2 obstacles), N=20 (3 obstacles), N=30 (4 obstacles)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Tasks are annotated by ensuring that paths adhere to grid movement constraints.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Evaluation through test cases

**Metrics**:
- Compliance Ratio (CR)
- Feasibility Ratio (FR)
- Optimal Ratio (OR)
- Geometric Mean (GM)
- Mean Square Error (MSE)
- Run Time (RT)

**Calculation**: Ratios are computed based on the number of compliant and feasible paths over total cases.

**Interpretation**: Higher values indicate better compliance, feasibility, and optimality of the path generated by LLMs.

**Baseline Results**: Results are compared against paths calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Validation**: Performance evaluated via metrics capturing correctness, optimality, and efficiency.

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data
- **Robustness**: Prompt leaking, Evasion attack

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: ['Path collisions with obstacles', 'Invalid paths through boundaries']
