# Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture

**Overview**: This work introduces a new dataset containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched with textual descriptions, to improve the retrieval of educational content in the agricultural metaverse.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Education
- Agriculture

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aliabdari/Agricultural_Metaverse_Retrieval)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create a retrieval system for educational agricultural museums that allows users to find relevant content based on textual queries.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Education Professionals
- Agricultural Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text-based Retrieval
- Cross-modal Retrieval

**Limitations**: There is a need to create a larger and more diverse dataset covering a wider range of agricultural topics.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Newly created dataset of agricultural-themed virtual museums.

**Size**: 457 museums

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Each museum is enriched with descriptions detailing the number of rooms, videos, and specific topics.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Recall@1 (R@1)
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the ranking of relevant museums found for the user's queries.

**Interpretation**: Higher R@1 and MRR indicate better retrieval performance.

**Baseline Results**: Existing benchmarks achieved up to +6% R@1 and 11% MRR improvements over previous works.

**Validation**: Extensive evaluation using various vision-language and video-based models.
