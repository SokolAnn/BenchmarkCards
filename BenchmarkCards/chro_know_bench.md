## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the ability of large language models to maintain and accurately recall knowledge over time, considering the dynamism of knowledge across various domains.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Knowledge Evaluation
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various structured datasets across domains including Wikidata, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and others.

**Size**: 17,000+ examples

**Format**: Structured triples with timestamps

**Annotation**: Automatically generated with manual verification

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Knowledge Elicitation via Temporal Snapshots
- Sampling-based Evaluation
- Automated metrics for accuracy assessment

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the number of correctly recalled knowledge points compared to a predefined answer set.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates a better ability of the model to recall and adapt to temporal knowledge.

**Validation**: Validation through extensive testing across different LLMs.
