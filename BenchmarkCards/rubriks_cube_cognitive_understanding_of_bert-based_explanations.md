# Rubrik’s CUBE (Cognitive Understanding of BERT-based Explanations)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: Rubrik’s CUBE (Cognitive Understanding of BERT-based Explanations)

**Overview**: Rubrik’s CUBE is a task-independent evaluation rubric and dataset aimed at assessing the quality of explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes 26,000 explanations generated across different tasks and evaluated using the proposed rubric.

**Data Type**: explanation pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate the quality of LLM-generated explanations based on a hierarchical rubric.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Explanatory Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: The dataset comprised explanations generated by humans and various LLMs across four tasks.

**Size**: 26,000 explanations

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Quality annotated by humans and LLMs using the Rubrik.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- LLM evaluation
