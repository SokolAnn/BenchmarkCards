# Human Simulacra

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Human Simulacra

**Overview**: This paper introduces a benchmark for LLMs personification, including a strategy for constructing virtual characters' life stories, a Multi-Agent Cognitive Mechanism for simulating human cognitive processes, and a psychology-guided evaluation method. The goal is to explore how LLMs can replace human subjects in experiments.
