# Inf-Bench (Infinite Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Inf-Bench (Infinite Benchmark)

**Overview**: Inf-Bench is a newly proposed benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in spatial deformation reasoning tasks. It encompasses forward and inverse reasoning tasks across 2D, 2.5D, and 3D spaces, highlighting the limitations of current models in handling complex spatial transformations.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- VSI-Bench
- SPGym
- iVISPAR

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate the spatial deformation reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models, identifying their capabilities and limitations in layered shape manipulations.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Spatial Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated by a fully automated data engine ensuring diversity and non-overlapping evaluation problem pairs.

**Size**: Unlimited evaluation pairs

**Format**: Structured question formats

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Ladder competition format for evaluation
- Automated metrics based on the highest difficulty level achieved

**Metrics**:
- Reasoning depth

**Calculation**: The reasoning depth is determined by the highest level (number of deformation steps) successfully completed by the models.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better spatial deformation reasoning capabilities in models.

**Validation**: Models must answer a series of progressively difficult tasks; failure to succeed at a level results in demotion or termination of the evaluation.
