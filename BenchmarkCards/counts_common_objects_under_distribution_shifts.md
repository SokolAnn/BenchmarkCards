**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Object Detection
- Grounding

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real-world images sourced and annotated through a combination of automated pipelines and human annotation.

**Size**: 222,234 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated through human verification for bounding boxes and domain information.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation
