## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating financial RAG systems, enabling continuous assessment with current information and facilitating research and practical applications in the finance sector.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: Due to time and compute constraints, only a small subset (10 out of 317 QA pairs) was used for response evaluation.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Financial documents, specifically 10-K filings from major companies.

**Size**: 317 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Generated using an LLM to analyze document nodes and create diverse question types.

## üî¨ Methodology
