# VolvoConstAct

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VolvoConstAct

**Overview**: VolvoConstAct is a new dataset tailored for Human Action Recognition (HAR) in construction sites, featuring visual, skeleton, and depth data modalities to improve the robustness and generalization of robotic systems in real-world construction environments.

**Data Type**: RGB images, depth data, and 2D and 3D human skeletons

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision
- Robotics

**Languages**:
- N/A

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://mmahdavian.github.io/ls_har/)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the VolvoConstAct dataset is to enhance the recognition of human actions in construction environments to instruct autonomous machines.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Human Action Recognition

**Limitations**: Data collection was limited to short and mid-range distances due to the ZED 2i camera‚Äôs limitations in long-range human pose detection.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: VolvoConstAct dataset created specifically for HAR in construction sites, featuring RGB images, depth data, and human skeletons.

**Size**: 20 videos with specific details captured

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Motions are captured and divided into action instructions performed by construction workers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation on multiple datasets including VolvoConstAct, NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA

**Metrics**:
