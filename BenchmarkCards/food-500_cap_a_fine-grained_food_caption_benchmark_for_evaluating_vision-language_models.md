# Food-500 Cap (A Fine-Grained Food Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Vision-Language Models)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Food-500 Cap (A Fine-Grained Food Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Vision-Language Models)

**Overview**: Food-500 Cap is a newly proposed benchmark dataset consisting of 24,700 food images with fine-grained captions detailing food attributes and geographic origins. It aims to evaluate vision-language models in the food domain, addressing their performance and biases across different culinary cultures.

**Data Type**: image-caption pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
