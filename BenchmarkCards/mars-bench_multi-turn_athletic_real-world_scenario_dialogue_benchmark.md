# MARS-Bench (Multi-turn Athletic Real-world Scenario Dialogue Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MARS-Bench (Multi-turn Athletic Real-world Scenario Dialogue Benchmark)

**Overview**: MARS-Bench is constructed from play-by-play text commentary to evaluate multi-turn dialogue robustness and long-context understanding in large language models. It focuses on Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn, and Cross-turn Tasks.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Sports

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation of large language models' abilities in handling complex multi-turn dialogues.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Instruction Following
- Context Retrieval
- Information Reasoning
- Task Switching

**Limitations**: Domain specificity may limit generalizability to open-domain dialogues; modality is limited to text.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Play-by-play text commentary from NBA and NHL games, structured for multi-turn dialogue modeling.

**Size**: 120 games

**Format**: Structured text

**Annotation**: Manually crafted questions based on game records.

## üî¨ Methodology
