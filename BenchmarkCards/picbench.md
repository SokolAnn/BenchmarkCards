## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of PICBench is to provide a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation methodology for automating the generation of PIC designs using LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Design Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated design problems and expert-written solutions for PIC design.

**Size**: 24 problems

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Each problem is crafted by human experts and includes a ground-truth design for evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated Evaluation
- Error Feedback Loop
- Simulation-based Testing

**Metrics**:
- Pass@k

**Calculation**: The Pass@k metric is calculated on the generated samples based on their correctness against unit tests.

**Interpretation**: A problem is considered solved if any of the k-generated samples passes the corresponding unit tests.

**Baseline Results**: Various existing LLMs were evaluated including GPT-4, GPT-o1-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

**Validation**: The benchmark uses an open-source simulator (SAX) to validate functionality and syntax of designs.
