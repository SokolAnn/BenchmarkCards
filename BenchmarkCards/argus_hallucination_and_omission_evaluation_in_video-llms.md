# ARGUS (Hallucination and Omission Evaluation in Video-LLMs)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ARGUS (Hallucination and Omission Evaluation in Video-LLMs)

**Overview**: ARGUS is a benchmark that measures freeform video captioning performance in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) by quantifying rates of hallucinations and omissions in generated video captions compared to human ground truth.

**Data Type**: video-caption pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- VideoHallucer
- EventHallusion
- VIDHAL

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate hallucination and omission rates in freeform captions generated by VideoLLMs, providing a fair platform for benchmarking.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Video Captioning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 500 videos curated from video understanding datasets, text-to-video generation datasets, and Creative Commons sources.

**Size**: 500 videos

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually annotated with cross-validation among the authors.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Entailment analysis
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- ArgusCost-H (hallucination rate)
- ArgusCost-O (omission rate)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on matching generated captions to human captions using a dynamic programming formulation to minimize hallucination costs.

**Interpretation**: Lower ArgusCost values indicate better performance with fewer hallucinations and omissions.

**Baseline Results**: Evaluation across 23 video models shows variable performance influenced by model characteristics.

**Validation**: Performance results validated using a human evaluation study with high agreement rates.
