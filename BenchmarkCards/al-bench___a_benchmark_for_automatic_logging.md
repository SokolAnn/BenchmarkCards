# AL-Bench : A Benchmark for Automatic Logging

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AL-Bench : A Benchmark for Automatic Logging

**Overview**: AL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for automatic logging tools. It evaluates logging quality through static and dynamic assessments, revealing significant limitations in existing logging tools.

**Data Type**: code snippets and log statements

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shuaijiumei/logging-benchmark-scripts)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized evaluation framework for automatic logging tools to assess their performance and quality.

**Target Audience**:
- Software Engineers
- ML Researchers
- Developers

**Tasks**:
- Logging Quality Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from 10 popular, high-quality GitHub projects with at least 10,000 stars and 500 log-related issues.

**Size**: 21,804 code snippets and 39,600 log statements

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Static Evaluation
- Dynamic Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Position Accuracy (PA)
- Level Accuracy (LA)
- Average Level Distance (ALD)
- Message Accuracy (MA)
- Dynamic Expression Accuracy (DEA)
- Static Text Similarity (STS) with BLEU and ROUGE
- Compilation Success Rate (CSR)
- Log File Similarity (LFS)
- False Positive Log Generation Rate (FPLR)
- False Negative Log Generation Rate (FNLR)

**Calculation**: Each metric is calculated based on the respective criteria detailed in the paper.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy rates indicate better performance of logging tools. Compilation rates reflect the feasibility of integrating generated log statements into code.

**Baseline Results**: Comparison of results from existing automatic logging tools including LANCE, UniLog, and FastLog.

**Validation**: N/A
