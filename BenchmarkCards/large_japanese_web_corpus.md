# Large Japanese Web Corpus

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Large Japanese Web Corpus

**Overview**: This paper builds a large Japanese web corpus by extracting and refining text from the Common Crawl archive, consisting of approximately 312.1 billion characters and approximately 173 million pages. The corpus is the largest available for training Japanese LLMs and has been shown to improve the performance of base LLMs on Japanese benchmark datasets by 6.6‚Äì8.1 points.
