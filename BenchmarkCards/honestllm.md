# HONESTLLM

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: HONESTLLM

**Overview**: This paper presents two approaches aimed at enhancing the honesty and helpfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs). It introduces a novel dataset called HONESET to evaluate LLM's honesty and provides methods for improvement through training-free and fine-tuning techniques.

**Data Type**: Text

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve LLMs by enhancing both their honesty and helpfulness in responses.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in AI ethics
- Developers of LLMs
- Data scientists

**Tasks**:
- Evaluating honesty in LLMs
- Developing improved LLM models

**Limitations**: Does not account for real-time queries or dynamic data updates.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: HONESET Dataset

**Size**: 930 queries

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: Curated by human experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Training-free enhancement using curiosity-driven prompting
- Fine-tuning approach with a two-stage process

**Metrics**:
