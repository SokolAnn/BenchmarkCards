# A Synthetic Dataset for Code Vulnerability Flaws

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: A Synthetic Dataset for Code Vulnerability Flaws

**Overview**: This paper proposes the creation of a synthetic dataset consisting of vulnerability-focused reviews that specifically comment on security flaws. The dataset is generated using Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce human-like code review comments for vulnerabilities.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering
- Computer Security

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective is to create a synthetic dataset of vulnerability-related code reviews to enhance the effectiveness of AI models in identifying and commenting on security-critical code.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Security Analysts
- Software Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Code Review
- Code Vulnerability Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: The synthetic dataset is generated from vulnerability-related commits in Java projects from GitHub.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated using Large Language Models to simulate human-like code review comments.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- LLM-based synthetic data generation
- Fine-tuning existing models on the synthetic dataset

**Metrics**:
- BLEU-4
- Semantic Equivalence
- Applicability

**Calculation**: BLEU-4 is used as the primary evaluation metric, with additional manual evaluations for semantic equivalence and applicability.

**Interpretation**: Higher BLEU scores indicate better quality and coherence of generated reviews compared to the ground truth.

**Baseline Results**: CodeReviewer and a fine-tuned version of CodeReviewer are used as baseline models.

**Validation**: Models are validated through comparison against a filtered security-related review dataset.
