# KOR-Bench (Knowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: KOR-Bench (Knowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning Benchmark)

**Overview**: KOR-Bench is designed to evaluate models‚Äô reasoning abilities across five task categories: Operation, Logic, Cipher, Puzzle, and Counterfactual, while minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge.

**Data Type**: rule-driven question-answer pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMLU
- MMLU-Pro
- GSM8K
- MATH

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates reasoning capabilities while reducing dependency on pre-existing knowledge.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Operation Reasoning
- Logic Reasoning
- Cipher Reasoning
- Puzzle Reasoning
- Counterfactual Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed using manual annotation and extensive logical reasoning tasks.

**Size**: 1,250 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Error Rate

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the correctness of the model's output compared to the expected answers derived from the rules.

**Interpretation**: A higher accuracy score indicates better reasoning capabilities of the model without reliance on specific training data.

**Baseline Results**: O1-Preview and O1-Mini models achieved accuracies of 72.88% and 70.16%, respectively.

**Validation**: The benchmark validation has been conducted through rigorous evaluations across multiple models.
