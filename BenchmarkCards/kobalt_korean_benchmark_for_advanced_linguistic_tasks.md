# KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks)

**Overview**: KoBALT is designed to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean by addressing the limitations of conventional benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It comprises 700 linguistically-motivated multiple-choice questions covering 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Korean

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://korean.go.kr/front/reportData/reportDataView.do?mn_id=207&report_seq=1160)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of KoBALT is to assess the advanced linguistic knowledge of large language models in a comprehensive manner.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Linguists
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Expert-curated multiple-choice questions designed by linguists.

**Size**: 700 questions

**Format**: multiple-choice

**Annotation**: Created by linguistically trained annotators

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is reported as the proportion of correctly predicted instances among the total number of questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance on linguistic tasks.

**Baseline Results**: The highest-performing model achieved 61% overall accuracy.

**Validation**: Validated through human preference evaluation with significant correlation to human judgments.
