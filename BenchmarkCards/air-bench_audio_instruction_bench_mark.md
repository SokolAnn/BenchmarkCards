# AIR-Bench (Audio InstRuction Bench mark)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: AIR-Bench (Audio InstRuction Bench mark)

**Overview**: AIR-Bench is the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LALMs to understand various types of audio signals (including human speech, natural sounds, and music), and interact with humans in text format. It consists of two dimensions: foundation and chat benchmarks.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the ability of large audio-language models to comprehend various audio signals and to follow human instructions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The benchmark does not incorporate tasks involving multiple audio comparisons and does not encompass the evaluation of multi-turn dialogues.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Various established audio datasets for speech, sound, and music, curated for performance assessments.

**Size**: approximately 19,000 single-choice questions and 2,000 open-ended audio questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually reviewed and generated with the assistance of GPT-4.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
