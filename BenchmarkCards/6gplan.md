**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated from expert prompts and verified through human corrections.

**Size**: 110 tasks and around 5,000 keywords

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human verification and correction for quality assurance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Macro Coverage Rate (MCR)
- Keyword Hit Count (KHC)
- Global Recall Rate (GRR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the comparison of generated solutions against a set of gold-standard keywords for each task.

**Interpretation**: Higher values in MCR, KHC, and GRR indicate better performance in retrieving and generating relevant solutions.

**Baseline Results**: MCR for Baseline: 36.99%, for Regular Debate: 49.75%, and for Hierarchical Debate: 81.19%.

**Validation**: Performance comparison with baseline techniques through experimental evaluations.
