# AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmark)

**Overview**: AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design by utilizing antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complexes as functional units.

**Data Type**: sequence data and binding affinity measurements

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MSBMI-SAFE/AbBiBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark framework for evaluating models that predict and design high-affinity antibodies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Affinity Prediction
- Antibody Sequence Design

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated datasets containing experimental binding affinity studies from public repositories.

**Size**: 155,853 mutated heavy chain antibodies across 9 antigens

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Correlation analysis between model likelihood and experimental affinity
- Zero-shot prediction of binding affinity
- Design of antibody variants

**Metrics**:
