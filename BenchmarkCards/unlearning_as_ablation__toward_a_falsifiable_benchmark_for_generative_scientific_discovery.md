# Unlearning as Ablation: Toward a Falsifiable Benchmark for Generative Scientific Discovery

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Unlearning as Ablation: Toward a Falsifiable Benchmark for Generative Scientific Discovery

**Overview**: This paper proposes unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. It focuses on testing whether large language models (LLMs) can derive new results after systematically removing prior knowledge associated with those results.

**Data Type**: N/A

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17681)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a methodology for testing the limits of LLMs in generative scientific discovery.

**Target Audience**:
- AI Researchers
- Cognitive Scientists
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Science Discovery Validation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: N/A

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Propositional Analysis
- Unlearning Techniques

**Metrics**:
- Success Rate
- Leakage Audits
- Utility Retention

**Calculation**: Calculation of success is based on whether the model can re-derive knowledge post unlearning.

**Interpretation**: Success indicates ability to generate knowledge; failure indicates dependence on memorized fragments.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: N/A

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Robustness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
No specific atlas risks defined

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: N/A
