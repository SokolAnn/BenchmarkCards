# Compass Direction Reasoning (CDR)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Compass Direction Reasoning (CDR)

**Overview**: The Compass Direction Reasoning (CDR) benchmark is designed to evaluate the direction reasoning capabilities of multimodal language models (MLMs). It includes three types of images to test spatial and compass directions, revealing that most MLMs struggle with direction reasoning.

**Data Type**: image-question pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the compass and spatial reasoning abilities of multimodal language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Spatial Reasoning
- Compass Direction Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Handcrafted image-question pairs specifically designed for this benchmark.

**Size**: 100,000 samples (including training and testing datasets)

**Format**: Image and text

**Annotation**: Manually annotated for direction reasoning with specific question types.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
