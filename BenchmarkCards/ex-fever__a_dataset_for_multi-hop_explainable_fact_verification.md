## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a high-quality dataset for improving explainability in multi-hop fact verification.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Fact Verification

**Limitations**: Evaluating the effectiveness of the system remains challenging, as the Rouge score may inadequately assess explanation quality.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Created from hyperlinked Wikipedia documents.

**Size**: 60,000 claims

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by crowd workers.

## üî¨ Methodology
