**Domains**:
- Telecommunications Engineering
- Electrical Engineering
- Probability and Statistics
- Signal Processing
- Computer Networking
- Operations Research
- Information Theory

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MATH
- GSM8K

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/netop/TeleMath)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a resource for evaluating Large Language Models on domain-specific mathematical problems in telecommunications.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Mathematical Problem Solving

**Limitations**: The seed dataset does not fully represent the entire telecommunications domain.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated from a seed dataset composed of problems designed by Subject Matter Experts.

**Size**: 500 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotations by Subject Matter Experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Synthetic data generation
- Benchmarking

**Metrics**:
- pass@1
- cons@16

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated over generated answers based on majority voting and single-attempt accuracy.

**Interpretation**: A higher pass@1 indicates that a model correctly generates the answer on its first attempt, while cons@16 reflects the consensus correctness across multiple attempts.

**Validation**: Semantic validation ensures questions are structurally equivalent to the original problems.
