## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Provide a large-scale and high-quality source of authentic news articles with published category information and metadata to enable various Natural Language Processing tasks and analyses of journalistic trends.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Kaggle community

**Tasks**:
- Semantic Tagging
- Named Entity Recognition
- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: HuffPost stopped maintaining an extensive archive after May 2018; the dataset contains about 200k headlines between 2012 and May 2018 and about 10k headlines between May 2018 and September 2022, so the authors recommend using the period 2012 to 2017 for temporal analyses. Categories with fewer than 1,000 articles were removed to reduce data skew.
