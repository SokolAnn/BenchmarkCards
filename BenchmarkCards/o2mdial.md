# o2mDial

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: o2mDial

**Overview**: o2mDial is a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the one-to-many (o2m) property of open-domain dialogue by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.

**Data Type**: dialogue contexts with multiple responses

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective is to facilitate Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS) in open-domain dialogue agents.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Dialogue System Developers

**Tasks**:
- Dialogue Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Curated from the DailyDialog corpus, consisting of sampled dialogues with multiple responses generated by distinct LLMs.

**Size**: 500 training samples, 100 test samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Responses were generated by five distinct LLMs and manually verified for fluency and coherence.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Semantic diversity
- Lexical diversity
- Contextual coherence

**Calculation**: Metrics for semantic and lexical diversity are combined to evaluate response sets.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate greater response diversity and coherence.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Empirical results demonstrated improved performance and diversity compared to traditional methods.
