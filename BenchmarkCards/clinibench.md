- Medical Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Diagnosis Prediction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: MIMIC-IV dataset, specifically focused on admission notes and discharge codes.

**Size**: 87,687 notes

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated by clinical experts within the healthcare domain.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
