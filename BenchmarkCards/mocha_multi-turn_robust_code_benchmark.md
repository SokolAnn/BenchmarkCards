# MOCHA (Multi-turn Robust Code Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MOCHA (Multi-turn Robust Code Benchmark)

**Overview**: MOCHA is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of code LLMs against multi-turn malicious coding prompts, focusing on vulnerabilities of models when faced with sophisticated adversarial attacks that decompose malicious tasks into seemingly benign subtasks.

**Data Type**: malicious coding prompts

**Domains**:
- Computer Security

**Languages**:
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a systematic evaluation benchmark for the robustness of code language models against adversarial and malicious prompts, particularly focusing on multi-turn interactions.

**Target Audience**:
- Cybersecurity Researchers
- Machine Learning Practitioners
- LLM Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Malicious Prompt Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated through a combination of language models and synthesized prompt engineering techniques.

**Size**: 10,084 training samples, 200 validation prompts, 200 test samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually verified for malicious intent and categorized based on threat types.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Adversarial evaluation
