# ANCHOR FUNCTION :A TYPE OF BENCHMARK FUNCTIONS FOR STUDYING LANGUAGE MODELS

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ANCHOR FUNCTION :A TYPE OF BENCHMARK FUNCTIONS FOR STUDYING LANGUAGE MODELS

**Overview**: The anchor function is a type of benchmark function designed for studying language models in learning tasks that follow an 'anchor-key' pattern. It simulates various language tasks while providing cost-effective and interpretable evaluation for academic research.
