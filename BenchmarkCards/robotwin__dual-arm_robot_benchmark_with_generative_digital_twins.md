## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: RoboTwin: Dual-Arm Robot Benchmark with Generative Digital Twins

**Overview**: RoboTwin is a comprehensive benchmark that includes both real-world teleoperated data and synthetic data generated by a digital twin, specifically designed for dual-arm robotic tool use and human-robot interactions.

**Data Type**: robotic task data

**Domains**:
- Robotics

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://robotwin-benchmark.github.io/early-version)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ario-dataset/ario-tools)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess dual-arm robots in various scenarios and bridge the gap in robotic training data.

**Target Audience**:
- Robotics Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Robot Manipulation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Real-world data collected from the COBOT Magic platform and synthetic data generated through digital twins.

**Size**: 30 trajectories for each of the 17 tasks

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Diverse high-quality annotations for tool usage and human-robot interactions.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Expert data generation

**Metrics**:
- Task success rate

**Calculation**: The task success rate is determined by testing the 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) on various tasks trained with differing amounts of expert data.

**Interpretation**: Higher success rates indicate better training data effectiveness in facilitating robotic task performance.

**Validation**: Tasks were designed with multiple stages and slower data collection for key sub-trajectories to enhance detail.
