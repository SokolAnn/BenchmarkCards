# MM-CamObj (Multimodal Dataset for Camouflaged Object Scenarios)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MM-CamObj (Multimodal Dataset for Camouflaged Object Scenarios)

**Overview**: The MM-CamObj dataset is constructed for the first time to improve large vision-language models (LVLMs) in understanding camouflaged objects. It includes two subsets: CamObj-Align, containing 11,363 image-text pairs for VL alignment, and CamObj-Instruct, comprising 11,363 images and 68,849 diverse instruction-following conversations.

**Data Type**: image-text pairs
