- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Multi-App Interaction

**Limitations**: The Mobile-Bench may struggle with general large models which exhibit pronounced illusions in API calls.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real user queries combined with generated data from LLMs.

**Size**: 832 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Mixed: real data from user queries and generated tasks through GPT-4.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- PassRate
- CheckPoint coverage

**Calculation**: CheckPoint coverage is calculated as the weighted sum of the scores based on package usage, key phrases, and API calls.

**Interpretation**: Interpretation revolves around determining the ability of the LLM-based agents to navigate and complete tasks in the predefined mobile environment.

**Baseline Results**: Performance results based on LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, showing variations in PassRate across task types.

**Validation**: Quality verification processes include cross-source validation of user-generated and GPT-4 generated tasks.
