- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: Despite the promising results, certain types of ambiguity may still be underrepresented.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from ambiguous queries and Wikipedia fragments.

**Size**: 2,000 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human-LLM interactive annotation with GPT-4o assistance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- G-Eval
