# EICAP-Bench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: EICAP-Bench

**Overview**: EICAP-Bench is a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to evaluate emotional intelligence capabilities in open-source large language models (LLMs) across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Arabic

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of EICAP is to evaluate the emotional intelligence of large language models in multi-turn conversations.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Emotion Tracking
- Causal Inference
- Emotionally Appropriate Response Generation

**Limitations**: The dataset‚Äôs focus on text-based interactions may overlook multi-modal cues such as vocal tone or facial expressions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset was created by expanding 53 seed scenarios into dialogues with multiple emotional responses, initially generated by GPT-4.

**Size**: 3,174 evaluation rows

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human annotators verified every dialogue and candidate reply for fidelity and clarity.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Zero-shot evaluation
- Statistical analysis

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is computed for each layer-subtask pair in the EICAP taxonomy using log probabilities.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better emotional intelligence competence.

**Validation**: Evaluation serves to assess baseline EI competence and reveal strengths and weaknesses in emotional reasoning.
