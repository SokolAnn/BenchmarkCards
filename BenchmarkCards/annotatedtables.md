# AnnotatedTables

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AnnotatedTables

**Overview**: AnnotatedTables is a large scale tabular dataset with large language model annotations. It addresses the tabular dataset annotation problem by using LLMs to automate annotation for SQL and other types of tag, containing 32,119 databases and 405,616 valid SQL programs.

**Data Type**: SQL queries

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- WikiSQL
- Spider

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To leverage large language models (LLMs) for annotating tabular datasets automatically, reducing the dependency on human labor for dataset annotation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Data Scientists
- Software Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Tabular Classification
- SQL Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collection of public Kaggle datasets with tabular data.

**Size**: 32,119 databases

**Format**: CSV, SQL

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) through zero-shot learning.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- LLM annotation
- Human evaluation of annotated output

**Metrics**:
- Execution accuracy
- Annotation validity rate

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the validity of SQL programs executed on their respective databases.

**Interpretation**: Higher execution accuracy indicates more reliable LLM-generated SQL queries.

**Baseline Results**: AnnotatedTables reports execution rates above 80% for SQL queries, indicating strong annotation quality.

**Validation**: Tests conducted included running SQL queries on the annotated tabular data to verify their correctness.
