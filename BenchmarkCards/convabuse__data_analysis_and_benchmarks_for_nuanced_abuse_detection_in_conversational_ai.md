# ConvAbuse: Data, Analysis, and Benchmarks for Nuanced Abuse Detection in Conversational AI

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ConvAbuse: Data, Analysis, and Benchmarks for Nuanced Abuse Detection in Conversational AI

**Overview**: We present the first English corpus study on abusive language towards three conversational AI systems gathered ‚Äòin the wild‚Äô. Our ConvAI dataset reflects fine-grained notions of abuse, as well as views from multiple expert annotators, identifying substantial differences in the distribution of abuse compared to other commonly used datasets.
