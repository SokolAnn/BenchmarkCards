# NoCode-bench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: NoCode-bench

**Overview**: NoCode-bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks. It consists of 634 tasks across 10 projects involving about 114k code changes in total, each of which pairs a user-facing documentation change and the corresponding code implementation that can be validated against developer-written test cases.

**Data Type**: feature addition tasks

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Software Engineering
