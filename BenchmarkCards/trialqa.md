# TRIALQA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TRIALQA

**Overview**: TRIALQA is a novel dataset comprising two social media collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer, designed specifically to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify potential clinical trial participants from social media posts.

**Data Type**: social media posts

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To investigate the use of large language models for efficiently recruiting clinical trial participants via social media by evaluating their ability to align user posts with trial eligibility criteria.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Clinical Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals

**Tasks**:
