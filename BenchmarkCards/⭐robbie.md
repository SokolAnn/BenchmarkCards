# ROBBIE

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ROBBIE: Robust Bias Evaluation of Large Generative Language Models

**Overview**: The paper discusses methods to evaluate and mitigate biases in large generative language models (LLMs) across various demographic axes and prompt-based datasets to ensure fair treatment of marginalized groups.

**Data Type**: Text

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Holistic Bias
- RealToxicityPrompts
- BOLD
- ToxiGen (v2)

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResponsibleNLP/tree/main/robbie)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResponsibleNLP/tree/main/AdvPromptSet)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop comprehensive metrics for measuring and mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- AI Researchers
- Data Scientists
- Practitioners deploying LLMs

**Tasks**:
- Evaluate biases in generative language models
- Develop and compare bias mitigation techniques

**Limitations**: None

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Evaluation of non-generative models

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Multiple text datasets including web crawls, Wikipedia, and user-generated content.

**Size**: Numerous datasets with thousands to millions of prompts.

**Format**: Text prompts along with corresponding labels (e.g. toxicity, demographic identities)

**Annotation**: Prompts are annotated using classifiers for toxicity and bias.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantitative analysis of generated text based on demographic axes
- Use of various bias metrics like AdvPromptSet and HolisticBiasR
- Bias/toxicity mitigation techniques evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Toxicity rate
- Negative regard score
- BiasScore

**Calculation**: The likelihood of negative responses about demographic subgroups is estimated through bootstrapping methods.

**Interpretation**: The interpretation of bias is contextual based on the proportion of negative output related to demographic prompts.

**Validation**: Results validated through human evaluators assessing generated text for toxicity and bias.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias in model outputs
- Toxic content generation
- Marginalization of demographic groups

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias, Decision bias
- **Privacy**: Personal information in prompt
- **Societal Impact**: Impact on education: plagiarism, Impact on affected communities

**Potential Harm**: ['Potential for reinforcing stereotypes', 'Truthfulness of generated content']

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: Aggregation of bias data may involve sensitive demographic information, ensuring careful handling and anonymization is essential.

**Data Licensing**: Datasets derived from publicly available web content.

**Consent Procedures**: Human evaluations conducted with appropriate consent mechanisms.

**Compliance With Regulations**: Adherence to ethical guidelines in AI deployment and data usage.
