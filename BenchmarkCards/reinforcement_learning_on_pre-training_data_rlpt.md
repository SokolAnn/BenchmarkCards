# Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data (RLPT)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data (RLPT)

**Overview**: RLPT is a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning. It utilizes a next-segment reasoning objective to derive reward signals from pre-training data without relying on human annotation, improving reasoning capabilities and generalization.
