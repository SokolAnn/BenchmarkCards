# CodeSumEval

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: CodeSumEval

**Overview**: CodeSumEval is a first-of-its-kind dataset curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation, featuring 411 summaries generated by seven different large language models, broken into 9933 entity-level samples.

**Data Type**: entity-level samples

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To study hallucination in code summarisation and evaluate the effectiveness of a framework for detecting such hallucinations.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Entity Recognition
- Hallucination Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Generated from the CodeXGLUE dataset using seven different large language models, focusing on Java programming.

**Size**: 10,000 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated by experts in Java programming using criteria for identifying hallucinations in code summaries.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Entity Verification
- Entity-Intent Verification

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: F1 Score is calculated based on the correctness of summaries and the mapping of entities to code.

**Interpretation**: A higher F1 Score indicates better performance in accurately detecting hallucinations in code summaries.

**Baseline Results**: Initial tests showed a 73% F1 Score using the proposed Entity Tracing Framework.

**Validation**: Evaluation involved checking if entities present in summaries correspond correctly to entities in the source code.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
