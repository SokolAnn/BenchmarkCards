## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BioMaze

**Overview**: BioMaze is a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs‚Äô ability to understand and reason about biological pathways, containing 5.1K high-quality, complex biological pathway problems derived from real research.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Biological Sciences

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs in biological tasks through the lens of biological pathways.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Biologists
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Biological Pathway Reasoning
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated from over 6,000 biological pathway research papers, involving True/False and open-ended questions.

**Size**: 5,100 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Questions reviewed and validated by human experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- Graph-Augmented Reasoning
