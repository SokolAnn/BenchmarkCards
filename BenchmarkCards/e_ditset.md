## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a focused evaluation environment for exploring Knowledge Element Overlap (KEO) within knowledge editing tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Knowledge Editing

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Knowledge triplets collected from Wikidata.

**Size**: 40,904 instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated question prompts using GPT-4.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Bipartite matching
- Knowledge editing techniques

**Metrics**:
- Efficacy Score (ES)
- Generalization Score (GS)
- Locality Score (LS)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the model's predictions following edits, comparing them to expected outputs.

**Interpretation**: Higher Efficacy, Generalization, and Locality scores indicate better performance of the editing method.

**Baseline Results**: SetKE outperformed existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in KEO scenarios.

**Validation**: Validated through experiments comparing SetKE's performance to other editing methods.
