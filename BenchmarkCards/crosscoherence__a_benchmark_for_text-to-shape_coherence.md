# CrossCoherence: A Benchmark for Text-to-Shape Coherence

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CrossCoherence: A Benchmark for Text-to-Shape Coherence

**Overview**: We propose the first benchmark for text-to-shape generation and manipulation that addresses the lack of high-quality paired text-3D datasets and effective metrics to evaluate coherence between generated 3D shapes and input textual descriptions, including a refined dataset, a new quantitative metric called CrossCoherence, and a human-validated dataset.

**Data Type**: shape-text pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Text2Shape

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the coherence between textual descriptions and 3D shapes generated from those descriptions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text-to-Shape Generation
- Shape Recognition

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: GPT2Shape, a refined dataset generated using improved text descriptions for existing shapes from Text2Shape based on human evaluation.

**Size**: 15,032 shapes, with a total of 75,358 shape-text pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically refined descriptions generated by a large language model (GPT-3) and validated through user studies.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- User evaluation
- Quantitative comparison of coherence metrics

**Metrics**:
- CrossCoherence
- CLIP-Similarity
- ShapeGlot

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the coherence scores derived from shape-text relations evaluated via cross-attention mechanisms.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate stronger coherence between the generated shape and the corresponding text description.

**Baseline Results**: CrossCoherence achieved 81.04% accuracy on chairs, outperforming other existing metrics.

**Validation**: Validated through human evaluation, using a user study comparing the quality of text descriptions.
