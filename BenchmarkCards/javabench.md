# JavaBench

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: JavaBench

**Overview**: JavaBench is a project-level benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their capability to generate Java code, specifically focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Data Type**: project-level Java code and tests

**Domains**:
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- Java

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HumanEval

**Resources**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To fill the gap of the scarcity and need for high-quality Java benchmarks for evaluating LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Four project assignments from an entry-level Java course.

**Size**: 389 methods, 106 Java classes

**Format**: Java source code

**Annotation**: Manual construction of projects and test cases by experienced Java programmers.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Completion@k
- Compilation@k
- Pass@k

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the number of completed, compilable, and test-passing solutions generated by LLMs.

**Interpretation**: Higher metrics indicate better performance in generating valid Java projects.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline is established through the performance of undergraduate students on the same projects.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments evaluating multiple LLMs across different scenarios.
