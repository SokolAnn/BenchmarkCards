# CharacterBox

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CharacterBox

**Overview**: CharacterBox is a simulation sandbox designed to generate situational fine-grained character behavior trajectories to evaluate the role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) more comprehensively. It consists of a character agent, grounded in psychological and behavioral science, and a narrator agent that coordinates interactions between character agents and environmental changes.

**Data Type**: behavior trajectories

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dynamic, multi-agent interactive virtual world for evaluating the role-playing capabilities of LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Role-Playing Evaluation

**Limitations**: Runtime efficiency needs improvement for large-scale evaluations.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Utilizes diverse scenes from well-known novels and scripts for role-playing evaluations.

**Size**: 100 scenes

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human experts annotate character trajectories based on detailed evaluation criteria.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation
- Trajectory analysis

**Metrics**:
- Knowledge Accuracy
