# On Measuring and Mitigating Biased Inferences of Word Embeddings

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: On Measuring and Mitigating Biased Inferences of Word Embeddings

**Overview**: This paper explores the stereotypes encoded in word embeddings and their impact on natural language inference (NLI) tasks, proposing a mechanism to measure and mitigate such biases.

**Data Type**: Word embeddings

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- N/A

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- N/A

**Resources**:
- [Resource](arXiv:1908.09369v3)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To measure and mitigate biased inferences in word embeddings using natural language inference tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in NLP
- Developers working on bias in AI

**Tasks**:
- Natural Language Inference
- Bias measurement
- Bias mitigation

**Limitations**: The study primarily focuses on gender bias and may not cover all biases comprehensively.

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Applications beyond NLP

## 💾 Data

**Source**: SNLI dataset

**Size**: Large (contains millions of sentence pairs)

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: NLP tasks tagged with entailment relationships

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Natural Language Inference (NLI)
- Debiasing via projection method

**Metrics**:
- Net Neutral (NN)
- Fraction Neutral (FN)
- Threshold measures

**Calculation**: Calculated bias from model probabilities of entailment, contradiction, or neutrality.

**Interpretation**: Scores close to 1 indicate low bias, while lower scores represent higher bias.

**Baseline Results**: GloVe, ELMo, and BERT embeddings exhibit substantial biases.

**Validation**: Evaluation against standard benchmarks in natural language inference tasks.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Gender bias
- Religion bias
- Nationality bias

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Value Alignment**: Toxic output
- **Robustness**: Hallucination

**Demographic Analysis**: Examined through gender, nationality, and religious attributes.

**Potential Harm**: Invalid inferences leading to potential reinforcement of stereotypes.

**Privacy And Anonymity**: Not Applicable

**Data Licensing**: The licensing for the SNLI dataset is publicly available.

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Not Applicable
