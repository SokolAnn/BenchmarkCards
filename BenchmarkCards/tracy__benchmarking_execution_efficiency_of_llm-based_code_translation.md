# TRACY: Benchmarking Execution Efficiency of LLM-Based Code Translation

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TRACY: Benchmarking Execution Efficiency of LLM-Based Code Translation

**Overview**: TRACY is the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution efficiency of LLM-translated code, constructed through an LLM-driven two-stage pipeline that generates a suite of stress tests followed by efficiency-oriented task pruning.

**Data Type**: code translation tasks

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- TransCoder-Test

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To introduce a benchmark focused on the execution efficiency of LLM-translated code.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers
- Code Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Translation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Sourced from Transcoder-Test, volume of 2,800 candidate tasks, filtered to 1,011 efficiency-critical translation tasks.

**Size**: 1,011 tasks

**Format**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Expert evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Efficiency evaluation
- Correctness checks

**Calculation**: Each LLM-generated translation is validated and scored based on execution time and memory usage against stress tests.

**Interpretation**: A higher Beyond score indicates better efficiency comparison against verified reference translations.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Validated against execution profiles through extensive evaluation on 26 LLMs.
