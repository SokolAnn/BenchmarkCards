## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated selection of 90 diverse multi-view scenes from Ego-Exo4D and EgoHumans datasets.

**Size**: 2,100 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by human evaluators to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Performance was measured by comparing MLLM responses to the correct answers determined by human evaluators.

**Interpretation**: A higher accuracy indicates better multi-view understanding capabilities of the evaluated models.

**Baseline Results**: Human-level performance achieved 95.7% accuracy across tasks.

**Validation**: The benchmark was validated through extensive testing against representative MLLMs.
