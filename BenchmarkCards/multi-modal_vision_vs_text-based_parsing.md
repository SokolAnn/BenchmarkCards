# Multi-Modal Vision vs. Text-Based Parsing

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Multi-Modal Vision vs. Text-Based Parsing

**Overview**: This benchmark evaluates eight multi-modal large language models on multiple invoice processing datasets, comparing direct image processing with structured parsing methods, providing insights for model selection and processing strategies.

**Data Type**: invoice image data

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate different LLM approaches for invoice processing using multiple datasets and processing strategies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Document Understanding

**Limitations**: The benchmark's performance may be constrained by specific document formats and extraction challenges, especially with alphanumeric fields.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Three diverse datasets: Clean Invoices (Donut), Scanned Receipts (ICDAR-2019-SROIE), and Scanned Invoices (inv-cdip)

**Size**: 1,850 images

**Format**: image files

**Annotation**: Structured JSON annotations and bounding boxes for text localization

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation against ground truth annotations
