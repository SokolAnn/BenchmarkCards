## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the multi-image spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models and provide insights for advancing spatial intelligence.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from multiple real-world datasets including ScanNet, Matterport3D, nuScenes, Ego4D, and others.

**Size**: 1,000 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human-annotated by experts after extensive review for quality and clarity.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated as the percentage of correct answers derived from exact matches between model outputs and ground-truth answers.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better spatial reasoning ability across multiple images.

**Baseline Results**: Human accuracy is approximately 97%, while top models score between 30-42%.

**Validation**: Extensive evaluation across 37 models was conducted to establish performance benchmarks.
