## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: RAGPPI (RAG Benchmark for Protein-Protein Interactions in Drug Discovery)

**Overview**: RAGPPI is a factual question-answer benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focuses on the potential biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Youngseung/RAGPPI)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/youngseungjeon/RAGPPI)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To support the research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.

**Target Audience**:
