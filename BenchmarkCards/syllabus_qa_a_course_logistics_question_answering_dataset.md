## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to provide a dataset for developing and evaluating automated question answering approaches for logistics-related questions in education.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Educators
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 63 unique course syllabi collected from instructors across 12 universities worldwide.

**Size**: 5,078 question-answering pairs

**Format**: PDF

**Annotation**: Crowd annotated by over 200 annotators simulating logistics-related QA pairs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- LLM-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Fact-QA Precision
- Fact-QA Recall
- ROUGE-L F1
- BERTScore F1

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated by evaluating factual information overlap between annotator-written ground truth answers and model predictions.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores in Fact-QA metrics indicate accurate and relevant answers, while lower scores suggest hallucination or factual inaccuracies.

**Baseline Results**: Human performance on Fact-QA Precision is 0.707, Recall is 0.664.

**Validation**: Evaluated across various LLM models and compared against human performance metrics.
