# SEMAN TICMEMES

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: SEMAN TICMEMES

**Overview**: We introduce the SEMANTICMEMES dataset of 3.8 million meme images clustered by their semantic function, constructed to analyze linguistic variation in memes across different communities on Reddit.

**Data Type**: image

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/naitian/semantic-memes)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To measure linguistic variation in memes and analyze how social factors contribute to this variation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Sociolinguists
- Social Media Analysts

**Tasks**:
- Linguistic Variation Analysis
- Multimodal Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Meme images scraped from Reddit.

**Size**: 3.8M images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Validated with human evaluation.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated clustering

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Visually adjusted precision

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on human judgment comparing semantic and visual similarity.

**Interpretation**: High precision indicates coherent semantic clusters, while lower visually adjusted precision suggests clustering is biased towards visual similarity.

**Baseline Results**: RoBERTa model has the highest visually-adjusted precision.

**Validation**: Human evaluators were used to assess coherence and similarity of meme clusters.
