## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of STRIDE-QA is to enable fine-grained spatial reasoning and temporal prediction in visual question answering for autonomous driving.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Autonomous Driving Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Object-centric Spatial QA
- Ego-centric Spatial QA
- Ego-centric Spatiotemporal QA

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Self-collected multi-sensor driving data from urban areas in Tokyo.

**Size**: 100 hours of driving data, 285 K frames, 16 million QA pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated through a modular pipeline combining LiDAR and multi-camera data.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Localization Success Rate (LSR)
- Mean Localization Success Rate (MLSR)
- Temporal Localization Consistency (TLC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on spatial and temporal predictions compared to ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher LSR, MLSR, and TLC scores indicate better spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline models included GPT-4o and InternVL2.5-8B, showing significantly lower performance compared to STRIDE-QA fine-tuned models.

**Validation**: Validation procedures were carried out using manually verified annotations.
