# Debate-Driven Evaluation for QA

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: Debate-Driven Evaluation for QA

**Overview**: This paper presents a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that transforms existing QA datasets into structured adversarial debates, enhancing the difficulty and assessing reasoning capabilities of models while addressing issues like data contamination.

**Data Type**: debate transcripts

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMLU-Pro

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/l6cao/Debate-Driven-Evaluation)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To offer a sustainable and effective path for evaluating the genuine reasoning ability of advanced language models through structured debate.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- AI Evaluators

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The study primarily employed only 50 MMLU-Pro questions, limiting domain-specific analysis reliability.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Structured debates derived from MMLU-Pro questions

**Size**: 5,500 debates totaling over 11,000 rounds of argumentation

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: Arguments were generated based on a structured debate protocol.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Double round-robin debates

**Metrics**:
- Total win count

**Calculation**: Win counts are aggregated for reproducible, order-independent rankings.

**Interpretation**: A higher total win count indicates stronger reasoning capabilities of the model.

**Baseline Results**: Empirical results were collected from various models including DeepSeek V3 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

**Validation**: The methodology was validated through extensive empirical experiments with multiple models.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness
- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Data contamination
- **Fairness**: Decision bias
- **Robustness**

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A
