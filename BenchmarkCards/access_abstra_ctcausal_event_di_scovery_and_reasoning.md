# ACCESS (Abstra CtCausal Event Di Scovery and ReaSoning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ACCESS (Abstra CtCausal Event Di Scovery and ReaSoning)

**Overview**: ACCESS is designed for discovery and reasoning over abstract causal events, focusing on causality of everyday life events at an abstraction level. The benchmark includes 725 event abstractions and 1,494 causal relations.

**Data Type**: causal pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CRAB
- GLUCOSE

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/isVy08/ACCESS)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To explore event causality at the abstraction level as a more efficient representation of knowledge.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Causal Discovery
- Event Abstraction

**Limitations**: ACCESS is built upon GLUCOSE with a scope limited to everyday children's stories, which may introduce biases.
