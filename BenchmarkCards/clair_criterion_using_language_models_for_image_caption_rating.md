# CLAIR (Criterion using LAnguage models for Image caption Rating)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CLAIR (Criterion using LAnguage models for Image caption Rating)

**Overview**: CLAIR is a novel method that leverages the zero-shot language modeling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate image captions. It aims to provide a holistic score that aligns closely with human judgments and successfully correlates with human evaluations of caption quality.

**Data Type**: caption-image pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- BLEU
- CIDEr
- SPICE
- ROUGE

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://davidmchan.github.io/clair/)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide an improved evaluation framework for image captioning using large language models indicating how well captions describe their corresponding images.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Image Captioning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Diverse benchmarks including MS-COCO, Flickr8K, and PASCAL-50S datasets.

**Size**: Multiple datasets: e.g., 5,000 images in MS-COCO subset.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human-annotated captions and machine-generated captions for comparison.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Kendall‚Äôs œÑ
- Spearman‚Äôs œÅ
- Pearson r

**Calculation**: Correlation coefficients calculated using ratings from multiple models and human evaluations.

**Interpretation**: Higher correlation values indicate better alignment with human preferences.

**Baseline Results**: CLAIR demonstrates improved correlation with human judgments compared to BLEU, CIDEr, ROUGE, and SPICE.

**Validation**: Evaluated against various established benchmarks, showing superior performance.
