# DVCD (Drone View Change Detection)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: DVCD (Drone View Change Detection)

**Overview**: The DVCD dataset is a drone-based change detection dataset consisting of 13,800 image pairs of building changes in diverse urban and rural scenarios collected from urban areas in Guangdong Province, reflecting typical changes such as new construction, demolition, and expansion during rapid urban development. It includes fine-grained textual descriptions to guide the model to focus on semantic change features.
