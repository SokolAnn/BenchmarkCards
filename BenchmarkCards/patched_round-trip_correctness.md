# Patched Round-Trip Correctness

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Patched Round-Trip Correctness

**Overview**: This paper introduces Patched Round-Trip Correctness (Patched RTC), a novel evaluation technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to diverse software development tasks, particularly focusing on outer loop activities such as bug fixing, code review, and documentation updates.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a self-evaluating framework for measuring consistency and robustness of LLM responses in software development tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Bug Fixing
- Code Review
- Documentation Updates

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Open-source implementation available for various software development tasks.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Patched RTC score

**Calculation**: Comparison of generated responses using similarity scores to determine correctness.

**Interpretation**: A similarity score above a threshold indicates that the model's response is considered correct.
