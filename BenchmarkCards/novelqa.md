## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the long-context comprehension abilities of LLMs using complex narratives from novels.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Natural Language Processing Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 65 free public-domain books from Project Gutenberg and 24 copyright-protected books purchased online.

**Size**: 2305 QA tuples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotations performed by expert annotators with detailed, human-crafted questions and corresponding answers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model outputs compared to ground truth answers.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better model performance in understanding and responding to questions based on long textual contexts.

**Baseline Results**: Human baselines achieved around 90% accuracy in generative settings.

**Validation**: Evaluated with various long-context LLMs to assess their long-context understanding.
