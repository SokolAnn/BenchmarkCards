# NICO (Natural Interactive COnversation)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: NICO (Natural Interactive COnversation)

**Overview**: NICO is a Natural Interactive Conversation dataset in Chinese designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to simulate natural human conversations and to improve their conversational capabilities through fine-tuning. The dataset consists of dialogues covering 20 daily topics and incorporates five types of social interactions, with a focus on fluency, coherence, and naturalness.

**Data Type**: dialogue pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and improve the conversational abilities of LLMs by providing a dataset that fosters more natural dialogue interactions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Open-domain dialog
- Dialog completion
- Identifying unnatural sentences
- Rewriting unnatural sentences

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Constructed dialogues generated using GPT-4-turbo and revised by native Chinese speakers.

**Size**: 4,000 dialogues

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by native Chinese speakers to ensure grammatical correctness and naturalness of conversations.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
