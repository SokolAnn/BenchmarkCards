# STSBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: STSBench

**Overview**: STSBench is a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. It evaluates spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through generated multiple-choice questions from pre-defined traffic scenarios using datasets such as NuScenes.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- DriveMLLM
- NuScenes-MQA
- NuScenes-QA

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of vision-language models in the context of autonomous driving.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The NuScenes dataset; pre-defined scenarios are mined and human-verified for validity.

**Size**: 971 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human verification of scenarios

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correctly answered multiple-choice questions, reported as a weighted mean across all scenarios.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better model performance in spatio-temporal reasoning under various driving scenarios.

**Baseline Results**: Various models including LLMs and VLMs evaluated by accuracy on specific scenarios.

**Validation**: Scenarios mined from the dataset undergo human verification to ensure accuracy.
