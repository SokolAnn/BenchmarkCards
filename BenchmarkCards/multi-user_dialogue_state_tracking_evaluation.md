# Multi-user Dialogue State Tracking Evaluation

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Multi-user Dialogue State Tracking Evaluation

**Overview**: This paper introduces a novel method to assess the robustness of large language models in multi-user dialogue state tracking (DST), extending an existing DST dataset by generating additional user utterances via speech act theory.

**Data Type**: dialogue conversations

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MultiWOZ

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10504)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate multi-user dialogue state tracking capabilities of LLMs and highlight the challenges faced in these scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Dialogue System Developers

**Tasks**:
- Dialogue State Tracking

**Limitations**: While the methodology allows for extended multi-user dialogue evaluation, it does not fully capture the dynamic nature of real-world multi-user interactions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Extended from the MultiWOZ dataset

**Size**: 1,000 conversations

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated by LLM based on speech acts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- LLM-based utterance generation
- Statistical analysis of performance metrics

**Metrics**:
- Joint Goal Accuracy (JGA)

**Calculation**: JGA is calculated based on whether all predicted slot values match the ground truth at each dialogue turn.

**Interpretation**: Higher JGA indicates better performance in accurately tracking dialogue state.

**Baseline Results**: Performance compared against the original MultiWOZ dataset.

**Validation**: Data validation through manual inspection of generated utterances.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Fairness**: Data bias

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A
