# MMRA (Multi-granularity Multi-image Relational Association)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MMRA (Multi-granularity Multi-image Relational Association)

**Overview**: The MMRA benchmark evaluates the associative relations between multiple images through a meticulously curated dataset comprising 1,024 samples, structured into 11 subtasks to assess the capabilities of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in recognizing and analyzing similarities across images.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English
