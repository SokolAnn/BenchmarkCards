# FinNLI (Financial Natural Language Inference)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FinNLI (Financial Natural Language Inference)

**Overview**: FinNLI is a benchmark dataset for Financial Natural Language Inference (NLI) that includes diverse premise-hypothesis pairs across various financial texts such as SEC Filings, Annual Reports, and Earnings Call transcripts. It aims to expose weaknesses in current large language models (LLMs) for financial reasoning.

**Data Type**: premise-hypothesis pairs

**Domains**:
- Finance

**Languages**:
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The goal of FinNLI is to evaluate and improve NLI model performance in the financial domain, thus enhancing downstream applications of natural language processing in finance.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Natural Language Inference

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is constructed from real-world financial documents including Annual Reports, SEC Filings, and Earnings Calls.

**Size**: 21,304 pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated by finance experts, the dataset includes a high-quality test set of 3,304 instances.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Macro F1 Score

**Calculation**: The Macro F1 Score is calculated as the average of F1 scores across all classes in the test set.

**Interpretation**: Higher Macro F1 Scores indicate better performance of the NLI models on the financial reasoning tasks.

**Baseline Results**: The highest Macro F1 scores observed were 74.57% for pre-trained language models and 78.62% for large language models.

**Validation**: The dataset was validated through expert annotation and pre-processing to ensure quality.
