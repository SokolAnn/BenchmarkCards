# Subpopulation Structure Discovery with Large Language Model (SSD-LLM)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Subpopulation Structure Discovery with Large Language Model (SSD-LLM)

**Overview**: We introduce a novel concept of subpopulation structures to represent, analyze, and utilize subpopulation distributions within datasets. The SSD-LLM framework employs large language models to analyze informative image captions and summarize the structures, facilitating tasks such as dataset subpopulation organization, subpopulation shift, and slice discovery.
