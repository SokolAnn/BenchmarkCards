## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and enhance the reasoning capabilities of audio-visual large language models (LLMs) through structured reasoning data.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Audio-Visual Question Answering
- Audio-Visual Captioning
- Audio-Visual Compositional Understanding
- A V-GeoIQ
- A V-Meme
- Dance and Music Matching

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from Music-A VQA, A VSD, and V ALOR datasets along with additional manual inspection for task creation.

**Size**: 4500 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Reasoning steps are generated through a structured multi-agent system.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Multi-agent evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Top-1 accuracy
- BLEU Score
- METEOR
- ROUGE

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the correctness of the generated reasoning steps against given questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better reasoning capabilities of the models in processing audio-visual content.

**Baseline Results**: Various audio-visual LLMs are evaluated against AVReasonBench.

**Validation**: Comparative validation against existing benchmarks such as VideoMME.
