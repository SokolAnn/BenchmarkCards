# P-FOLIO

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: P-FOLIO

**Overview**: P-FOLIO is a human-annotated dataset consisting of diverse and complex reasoning chains for a set of realistic logical reasoning stories, written by humans, collected using a structured annotation protocol.

**Data Type**: natural language proofs

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and improve large-language-model (LLM) reasoning capabilities using expert-written proof chains.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Single-step Inference Rule Classification
- Single-step Derivation Reasoning
- Proof Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Expert-written logical reasoning for an existing dataset of logical reasoning, FOLIO.

**Size**: 1,430 proofs
