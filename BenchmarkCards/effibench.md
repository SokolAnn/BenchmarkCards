# EFFIBENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: EFFIBENCH

**Overview**: EFFIBENCH is a benchmark with 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems designed to assess the efficiency of code generated by language models, specifically looking at execution time and memory usage during execution.

**Data Type**: coding problems with executable solutions

**Domains**:
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HumanEval
- APPS
- BigCodeBench
- DS-1000

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the efficiency of automatically generated code by code generation models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Model Evaluators

**Tasks**:
- Efficiency Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: LeetCode problems focused on coding efficiency analysis.

**Size**: 1,000 problems

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Canonical solutions provided for each problem that achieve state-of-the-art efficiency.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Normalized Execution Time (NET)
- Max Memory Usage (MU)
- Total Memory Usage (TMU)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the execution times and memory usage of generated and canonical solutions.

**Interpretation**: A NET value greater than 1 indicates that the generated code is slower than the canonical solution.

**Baseline Results**: Performance of language models evaluated against human-written solutions.

**Validation**: Efficiency evaluated on multiple LLMs using identical coding problems.
