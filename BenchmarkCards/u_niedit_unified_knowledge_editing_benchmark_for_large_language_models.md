## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and enhance the editing capabilities and generalization robustness of LLM editors in open-domain knowledge.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Knowledge Editing

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Wikidata, the largest open-source knowledge graph.

**Size**: 311,142 instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated from knowledge graphs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Reliability
- Generality
- Locality

**Calculation**: Performance scores are calculated based on the ability of the edited LLM to correctly recall the edited knowledge in different contexts.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better reliability, generality, and locality in LLM performance after editing.

**Validation**: Comprehensive experiments testing various LLMs' performance on the benchmark.
