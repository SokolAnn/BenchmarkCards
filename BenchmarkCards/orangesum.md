# OrangeSum

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OrangeSum

**Overview**: OrangeSum is a novel French summarization dataset, designed to address the lack of generative tasks in the existing FLUE benchmark, enabling the evaluation of summarization models for the French language.

**Data Type**: summarization pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- French

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- XSum

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Tixierae/OrangeSum)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a dataset for evaluating abstractive summarization models for the French language.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Summarization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Scraped articles from the Orange Actu website, featuring titles and abstracts for summarization tasks.

**Size**: 6,000 examples

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Manual extraction from the scraped articles

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- ROUGE-1
- ROUGE-2
- ROUGE-L
- BERTScore

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on n-gram overlap and contextual similarity for summarization text.

**Interpretation**: Higher ROUGE scores indicate better alignment between generated summaries and gold references.

**Baseline Results**: Performance comparisons against XSum and BART-based models.

**Validation**: Model performance is validated through quantitative metrics and human evaluation.
