# SCENE (Soft Counterfactual Evaluation for Natural language Explainability)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SCENE (Soft Counterfactual Evaluation for Natural language Explainability)

**Overview**: SCENE is a novel evaluation method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate Soft Counterfactual explanations in a zero-shot manner, focusing on token-based substitutions to create contextually appropriate and semantically meaningful explanations for explainable AI (XAI) techniques in natural language processing tasks.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized framework for evaluating the effectiveness of explainable AI techniques in identifying significant tokens in sentiment analysis tasks through the use of Soft Counterfactuals.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Sentiment Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST2)

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Model-based evaluation
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Validitysoft
- Csoft
- Mean Average Precision (MAP)
- Infidelity

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the changes in model output probabilities when using Soft Counterfactuals compared to original inputs.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better identification of significant tokens in relation to model behavior.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The effectiveness of the evaluation metrics was validated through empirical results across various model architectures (CNN, RNN, and Transformer).
