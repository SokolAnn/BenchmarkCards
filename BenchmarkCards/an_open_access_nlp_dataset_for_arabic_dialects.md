# An open access NLP dataset for Arabic dialects

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: An open access NLP dataset for Arabic dialects

**Overview**: This paper presents an open data set of social data content in several Arabic dialects, collected from Twitter and consisting of +50K tweets in five national dialects, labeled for several applications such as dialect detection, topic detection, and sentiment analysis.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Arabic

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://msda.um6p.ma/msda_datasets)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Elmehdidebug/NLP-for-dialectDetection-TopicDetection-SentimentAnalysis)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enhance innovation and practical applications of NLP for dialectal Arabic by providing an open access dataset.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Classification
- Dialect Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Tweets collected from Twitter in five Arab countries (Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco).

**Size**: 50,000 tweets

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual labeling with a semi-automatic process for dialect detection, topic detection, and sentiment analysis.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Machine Learning
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- SGD Classifier
- Linear SVC

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: F1 Score is calculated using precision and recall. Accuracy is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.

**Interpretation**: Performance evaluation is used to assess the effectiveness of the models in identifying dialects, topics, and sentiments.

**Validation**: The dataset was validated through performance evaluation of machine learning models on the labeled data.
