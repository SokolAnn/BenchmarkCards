# TOOLSCAN

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TOOLSCAN

**Overview**: TOOLSCAN is a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on tool-use tasks, designed to identify error patterns and provide detailed diagnostic feedback. It comprises a dataset of queries from diverse environments that can be used to test for seven newly characterized error patterns in LLM outputs.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of TOOLSCAN is to characterize common errors in tool-use LLMs and provide detailed diagnostic feedback to improve their performance.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- API Developers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Error Pattern Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: TOOLSCAN dataset created through augmented queries sourced from benchmark tests conducted on Toolsets.

**Size**: 150 queries

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human-annotated to highlight multiple pathways to reach objectives.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Feedback Mechanism

**Metrics**:
- Success Rate
- Error Pattern Metrics

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the percentage of API calls executed without error patterns.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores on error metrics indicate fewer issues generated by a model.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Data filtered based on feasibility evaluation, constraint validation, and diversity.
