## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a flexible framework for representing synthesis procedures that captures real-world complexities and enables automated synthesis planning and optimization.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Materials Scientists
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Graph-based analysis
- Material synthesis optimization

**Limitations**: MatPROV remains relatively small in scale compared with existing datasets and has potential extraction accuracy issues.

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Direct synthesis implementation without prior validation against original sources.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthesis procedures extracted from 1,568 open-access scientific papers.

**Size**: 2,367 procedures

**Format**: PROV-JSONLD

**Annotation**: Automated extraction using LLMs, followed by expert validation for accuracy.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated extraction using LLMs

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
