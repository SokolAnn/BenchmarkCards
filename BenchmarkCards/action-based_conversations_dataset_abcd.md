# Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD)

**Overview**: ABCD is a fully-labeled dataset with over 10K human-to-human dialogues containing 55 distinct user intents requiring unique sequences of actions constrained by policies to achieve task success. It aims to enhance the realism of task-oriented dialogue systems by incorporating procedural, dual-constrained actions.
