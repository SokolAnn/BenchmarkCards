# MCP-R ADAR

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MCP-R ADAR

**Overview**: MCP-R ADAR is the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy, tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter construction accuracy, and execution speed.

**Data Type**: task datasets

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering
- Mathematical Reasoning
- General Problem Solving

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MCPRadar-B143)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a systematic methodology for assessing and improving the ability of large language models to utilize tools effectively within the MCP framework.

**Target Audience**:
- LLM Developers
- MCP Ecosystem Contributors

**Tasks**:
- Tool Use Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Tasks selected from high-quality open-source datasets, including GAIA, GSM8k, MATH, HumanEval, and MBPP.

**Size**: 300 tasks

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Tasks undergo multiple rounds of validation with domain experts creating tasks, verifying solutions, and ensuring consistency.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantitative performance evaluation
- Radar chart visualizations

**Metrics**:
- Result Accuracy (RA)
- Dynamic Tool Selection Rate (DTSR)
- First Error Position (FEP)
- Computational Resource Efficiency (CRE)
- Response Time Efficiency (RTE)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the task completion success rates and efficiency measures.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores in RA, DTSR, and lower CRE, RTE indicate better model performance.

**Baseline Results**: Results from seven mainstream LLMs across three core task domains.

**Validation**: Experimental validation against seven different LLMs under identical conditions.
