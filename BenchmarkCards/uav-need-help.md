## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To promote research and development in UAV vision-language navigation tasks through realistic trajectories and assistant-guided object searches.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Vision-Language Navigation
- Object Search

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed using the OpenUAV platform with real flight simulation data and human control.

**Size**: 12,149 trajectories

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human annotators conducted a continuous flight on the OpenUA V platform, generating descriptions using GPT-4 and reviewing for quality.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Success Rate (SR)
- Oracle Success Rate (OSR)
- Success weighted by Path Length (SPL)
- Navigation Error (NE)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on UAV's success in navigating to target objects as per provided instructions in various scenarios.

**Interpretation**: Higher metrics indicate better navigation performance and efficiency in reaching target locations.

**Baseline Results**: Compared against Random, Fixed Action, and CMA models with results indicating significant improvements over baselines.

**Validation**: Validated through closed-loop evaluations and comparisons across metrics in seen and unseen environments.
