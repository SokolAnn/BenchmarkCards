# CogBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CogBench

**Overview**: CogBench is a benchmark that includes ten behavioral metrics derived from seven cognitive psychology experiments to evaluate the behavior of large language models (LLMs). It provides a comprehensive assessment beyond traditional performance metrics.
