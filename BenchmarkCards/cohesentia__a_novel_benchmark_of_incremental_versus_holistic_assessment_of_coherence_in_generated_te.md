# COHESENTIA: A Novel Benchmark of Incremental versus Holistic Assessment of Coherence in Generated Texts

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: COHESENTIA: A Novel Benchmark of Incremental versus Holistic Assessment of Coherence in Generated Texts

**Overview**: COHESENTIA is a new benchmark for human assessment of the coherence of automatically generated texts, where text coherence is evaluated through both holistic and incremental scoring methods, allowing for insights into factors contributing to coherence.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- GCDC (Grocery Coherence Dataset)

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AviyaMn/CoheSentiaprotocol)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark for automatic coherence assessment of generated texts and explore factors affecting coherence.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Coherence Scoring
- Coherence Reasoning

**Limitations**: The benchmark is composed of stories generated from GPT-3 and may not generalize to other models or languages.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 500 human-annotated paragraphs generated by GPT-3

**Size**: 500 paragraphs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human annotations via Amazon Mechanical Turk

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Coherence scores were averaged from multiple raters and clustered into defined groups.

**Interpretation**: A higher score indicates better coherence as rated by human annotators.

**Validation**: Inter-annotator agreement was assessed to ensure reliability of the scoring methods.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data
- **Fairness**: Data bias

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: The generated texts were created without checking for potential harmful content, and annotators were chosen without biases.

**Data Licensing**: Not Applicable

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Not Applicable
