# When, Where, and What? A Novel Benchmark for Accident Anticipation and Localization with Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: When, Where, and What? A Novel Benchmark for Accident Anticipation and Localization with Large Language Models

**Overview**: This study introduces a novel benchmark that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance predictive capabilities in anticipating and localizing traffic accidents, utilizing innovative mechanisms to identify when and where accidents might occur.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- DAD (Dashcam Accident Dataset)
- CCD (Car Crash Dataset)
- A3D (AnAn Accident Detection dataset)

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop a comprehensive framework for anticipating and localizing vehicle accidents using Large Language Models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Accident Prediction
- Accident Localization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Empirical validation on the DAD, CCD, and A3D datasets.

**Size**: 620 dashcam recordings (DAD dataset) with 1750 video segments

**Format**: video

**Annotation**: Annotations for object detection bounding boxes, object IDs, object categories, and labels indicating the occurrence of accidents.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Average Precision (AP)
- Mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA)
- Accident Object Localization Accuracy (AOLA)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on prediction results from the model compared to ground truth labels across various datasets.

**Interpretation**: Higher AP indicates better accuracy in predicting accidents, while mTTA reflects earlier predictions before accidents occur.

**Validation**: Model performance validated against existing approaches on several benchmark datasets.
