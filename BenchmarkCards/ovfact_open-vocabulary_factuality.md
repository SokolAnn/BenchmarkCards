# OVFact (Open-Vocabulary Factuality)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OVFact (Open-Vocabulary Factuality)

**Overview**: OVFact is a method for measuring and improving open-vocabulary factuality in vision-language models (VLMs) that output long, descriptive captions. It combines aspects of both precision and recall to assess factuality without relying on ground-truth human annotations.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a method for assessing the factuality of long VLM-generated captions and enable new applications like data filtering.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation
- Image Captioning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: OVFact-filtered subsets of large-scale, noisy pretraining sets generated by VLMs.

**Size**: 2.5-5x smaller datasets compared to the original pretraining set

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: The data is filtered without requiring human annotations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Precision is calculated as the ratio of grounded entities to candidate entities, and recall measures the coverage of diverse objects grounded in the image.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better factuality in generated captions.

**Validation**: Validation was done through experiments comparing OVFact scores with human evaluations and performance on downstream tasks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Fairness**: Data bias

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: N/A
