# FictionalQA

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FictionalQA

**Overview**: The FictionalQA dataset empowers researchers to study the dual processes of fact memorization and verbatim sequence memorization using synthetically-generated documents about fictional events and associated question-answer pairs.

**Data Type**: question-answer pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- TriviaQA
- TOFU
- Fictional Knowledge

**Resources**:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jwkirchenbauer/fictionalqa)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To study the processes and dynamics of memorization in language models, particularly focusing on distinguishing fact memorization from verbatim memorization.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Academic Institutions

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic generation process based on fictional events.

**Size**: 7,500 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated generation with controlled prompts for question and answer creation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated by evaluating model performance on question-answer pairs derived from the fictional documents.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better memorization and transfer of knowledge from training to inference.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The dataset includes various validation splits to assess model performance on generalization.
