# CETVEL

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CETVEL

**Overview**: CETVEL is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. It addresses gaps in existing benchmarks by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative tasks, ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of the Turkish language.

**Data Type**: text

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of CETVEL is to provide a culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners
- Language Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Extractive Question Answering
- Multiple Choice Question Answering
- Text Classification
- Natural Language Inference
- Summarization
- Machine Translation
- Grammatical Error Correction

**Limitations**: CETVEL is limited to open-weight models with up to 70B parameters; it does not include proprietary models restricted by API changes.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A combination of publicly available datasets, specifically curated datasets, and adapted versions of existing datasets.

**Size**: 10,000 examples

**Format**: Various formats including JSON and CSV

**Annotation**: Crowdsourced and manual annotation by experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
