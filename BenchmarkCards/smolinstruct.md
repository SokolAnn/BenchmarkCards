## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To facilitate research and applications in chemistry by providing a comprehensive dataset for instruction tuning of large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Chemistry Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Name Conversion
- Property Prediction
- Molecule Captioning
- Molecule Generation
- Forward Synthesis
- Retrosynthesis

**Limitations**: Despite high-quality curation, the dataset may still contain inaccuracies or be limited in assessing correctly generated descriptions or molecules.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various sources including PubChem, MoleculeNet, and USPTO-full.

**Size**: 3,288,855 samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Curated and quality-controlled by experts and checks for molecular validity.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Exact Match (EM)
- Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity (FTS)
- METEOR score
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the proportion of correct predictions and structural similarities.

**Interpretation**: Higher values for metrics like EM, Accuracy indicate better performance, while lower RMSE signifies improved predictions.

**Baseline Results**: SoTA task-specific models outperform LlaSMol models on most tasks, but LlaSMol demonstrates notable improvements.

**Validation**: Rigorous quality control applied during data collection and before model training.
