## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate language models' proficiency in a specific capability.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Instruction Following
- Grounding
- Reasoning
- Planning
- Refinement
- Safety
- Theory of Mind
- Tool Usage
- Multilingual

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Crafted through a human-in-the-loop approach, validated by multiple annotators.

**Size**: 765 instances across 77 tasks

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated manually by annotators with expertise in the relevant field.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Pearson correlation

**Calculation**: Correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between responses from evaluator language models and human judgments.

**Interpretation**: High values indicate strong correlation with human evaluators, reflecting reliability in assessment.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Performance comparisons to human evaluators indicate strong correlations across different capabilities.
