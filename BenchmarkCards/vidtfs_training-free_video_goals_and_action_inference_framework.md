# VidTFS (Training-Free Video Goals and Action Inference Framework)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VidTFS (Training-Free Video Goals and Action Inference Framework)

**Overview**: VidTFS is a training-free, open-vocabulary framework for video goal inference and action recognition, using frozen visual foundational models and large language models with dynamic frame selection.

**Data Type**: video

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- UCF101
- ActivityNet
- CrossTask
- COIN

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12471)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate video goal inference and action recognition without requiring any training.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Goal Inference
- Action Recognition

**Limitations**: Performance may degrade when LLMs exhibit hallucinations without clear logical reasoning.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various public video datasets including UCF101, ActivityNet, CrossTask, and COIN.

**Size**: 4,700 videos (CrossTask), 11,827 videos (COIN), 13,320 videos (UCF101), 19,994 videos (ActivityNet)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Visual frame captions generated by BLIP-2 model.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- METEOR
- SPICE
- CIDEr
- BERTScore
- SBERT

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on how well the generated inferences match the ground truths across various tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better alignment of generated hypotheses with ground truth.

**Baseline Results**: VidTFS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple tasks.

**Validation**: Results validated against widely accepted benchmarks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Fairness**: Data bias

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: The framework may inaccurately identify actions or goals due to LLM behavior.
