# CLOTHO (Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CLOTHO (Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs)

**Overview**: CLOTHO is a task-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty directly from hidden LLM states and ranks inputs by their likelihood of failure to improve task-specific LLM testing.

**Data Type**: input-output pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of CLOTHO is to improve task-specific LLM testing by prioritizing which inputs to run and label first, ideally exposing failures earlier and with less effort.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Test Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Error Detection
- Input Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Aggregated datasets across multiple tasks with specific prompts and input requirements.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Labelling is performed by human annotators based on model outcomes.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Error Rate Prediction
- Sample Prioritization

**Metrics**:
- ROC-AUC
- Spearman Rank Correlation

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the likelihood of passing inputs in relation to the reference distribution derived from hidden states.

**Interpretation**: A higher ROC-AUC score indicates better performance in failure prediction and test input prioritization.

**Baseline Results**: Tests were compared against existing pre-generation and post-generation metrics.

**Validation**: Validation of CLOTHO was performed across eight benchmark tasks.
