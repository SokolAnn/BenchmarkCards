# RSVLM-QA (Remote Sensing Vision Language Model Question Answering)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: RSVLM-QA (Remote Sensing Vision Language Model Question Answering)

**Overview**: RSVLM-QA is a new large-scale, content-rich Visual Question Answering dataset for the remote sensing domain, constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets. It aims to address existing limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and assessment of reasoning capabilities.

**Data Type**: Visual Question Answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Earth and Atmospheric Sciences

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StarZi0213/RSVLM-QA)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To advance Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) through a large-scale, richly annotated dataset.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Image Captioning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data constructed by integrating WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID datasets.

**Size**: 13,820 images and 162,373 Visual Question Answering pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated using large language models and a dual-track annotation generation pipeline.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
