## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: EEmo-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models on Image Evoked Emotion Assessment

**Overview**: EEmo-Bench is a benchmark dedicated to analyzing evoked emotions in images across diverse content categories, using a systematic evaluation framework that includes tasks such as Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment.

**Data Type**: image-emotion pairs, question-answer pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To comprehensively evaluate the image-evoked emotions perception and understanding capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Perception
- Ranking
- Description
- Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Images collected from Flickr, manually annotated by participants covering various emotional attributes including ranking and Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) scores.

**Size**: 1,960 images, 6,773 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by participants

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) scores

**Calculation**: Metrics are computed using the ranking scores and evaluation results from subjective human annotators.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in perceiving and ranking the emotions evoked by images.

**Validation**: Conducted through multiple annotation rounds and a consistency checks.
