## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a large multi-language dataset of narratives to facilitate various aspects of narrative research and improve narrative generation.

**Target Audience**:
- NLP Researchers
- Machine Learning Practitioners
- Story Generation Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Multilabel Classification
- Cross-lingual Learning
- Narrative Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Wikipedia articles that contain plot summaries in various languages.

**Size**: Over 20,000 stories across 42 languages

**Format**: TSV

**Annotation**: Automatically tagged using categories from Wiki API and manual tagging procedures.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
