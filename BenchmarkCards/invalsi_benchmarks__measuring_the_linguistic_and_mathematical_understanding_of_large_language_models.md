# Invalsi Benchmarks: measuring the Linguistic and Mathematical understanding of Large Language Models in Italian

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Invalsi Benchmarks: measuring the Linguistic and Mathematical understanding of Large Language Models in Italian

**Overview**: This work presents three new benchmarks: Invalsi MATE to evaluate models performance on mathematical understanding in Italian, Invalsi ITA to evaluate language understanding in Italian and Olimpiadi MATE for more complex mathematical understanding.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Education

**Languages**:
- Italian

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the performance of LLMs in Italian, on mathematical and language understanding.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Education Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: Invalsi ITA can be almost aced by the most powerful LLMs.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The benchmarks are based on the Invalsi tests administered to students in the Italian school system and the Italian national math Olympics.

**Size**: 1,039 questions for mathematical knowledge and 1,249 questions for language understanding

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually checked by two annotators with expertise in mathematics and computer science.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Likelihood-based evaluation
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: The accuracy is based on the model's performance on both mathematical and language understanding tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in understanding and reasoning in mathematical and linguistic contexts.

**Validation**: Performance validated by comparing LLMs against the performance of Italian students
