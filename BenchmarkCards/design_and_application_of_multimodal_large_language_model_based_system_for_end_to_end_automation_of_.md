## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Design and Application of Multimodal Large Language Model Based System for End to End Automation of Road Crash Database Generation

**Overview**: The study presents a fully automated crash data framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that includes web scraping, classification, information extraction, and deduplication of road crash data tailored for low-resource settings.

**Data Type**: structured data on road crashes

**Domains**:
- Transportation Safety
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Bengali

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/user/repo)
