# Improving Visual Storytelling with Multimodal Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Improving Visual Storytelling with Multimodal Large Language Models

**Overview**: This paper presents a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) combined with instruction tuning to improve visual storytelling. It introduces a new dataset comprising diverse visual stories, annotated with detailed captions and multimodal elements, and employs supervised and reinforcement learning techniques to enhance narrative generation capabilities.

**Data Type**: image sequences and narrative descriptions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to improve visual storytelling by integrating LLMs and LVLMs with instruction tuning for enhanced narrative coherence and contextual relevance.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Story Generation
- Emotion Recognition
- Character Consistency

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Comprehensive and diverse dataset collected from comics, illustrated books, and educational content.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated with detailed captions that describe the events, actions, and emotions depicted in the images.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Qualitative Human Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Coherence
- Relevance
