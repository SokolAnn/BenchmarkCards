# GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)

**Overview**: GEAK is a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD Instinct ‚Ñ¢MI300X and MI250. We introduce two benchmark suites for evaluating AI-generated Triton kernels, enabling measurement of both execution correctness and runtime performance of generated kernels.

**Data Type**: GPU kernel code

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To push the frontier of AI-assisted code generation by combining state-of-the-art LLMs with structured reasoning and feedback loops for automating Triton kernel development.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Practitioners
- Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Performance Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Triton kernels adapted from TritonBench-G and new kernels from open-source AMD ROCm repositories.

**Size**: 214 kernels

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Unit testing

**Metrics**:
- Call Accuracy
- Execution Accuracy
- Speedup

**Calculation**: Call Accuracy is calculated as the fraction of AI-generated kernels that can compile and run without errors. Execution Accuracy is the percentage of AI-generated kernels that satisfy all unit tests. Speedup is the ratio of median reference kernel latency to generated kernel latency.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and speedup values indicate better performance of the generated kernels.

**Validation**: The benchmarks were validated by testing multiple kernels and comparing the results against baseline standards.
