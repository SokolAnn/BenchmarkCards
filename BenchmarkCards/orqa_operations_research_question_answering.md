## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the reasoning capabilities and generalization abilities of LLMs in the context of Operations Research through a benchmark dataset.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset contains real-world optimization problems crafted by Operations Research experts.

**Size**: 1,513 instances
