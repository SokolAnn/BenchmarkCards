# Word Synchronization Challenge

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: Word Synchronization Challenge

**Overview**: This benchmark introduces the Word Synchronization Challenge, a novel benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It assesses LLMs’ ability to mimic human cognitive processes through word associations, simulating complex human interactions.

**Data Type**: dynamic word association data

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Human-Computer Interaction

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://word-sync.games/)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess LLMs’ capacity to predict and adapt within social interactions using their response to word associations.

**Target Audience**:
- AI Researchers
- HCI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Word Association

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Dynamic game simulation involving multiple LLMs.

**Size**: 70,000 participant responses

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated during game interactions

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Dynamic interaction game
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Success Rate
- Average Rounds

**Calculation**: Success rate is determined by the proportion of rounds where both participants produced the same word. Average rounds measure the mean number of turns before achieving a match.

**Interpretation**: Higher success rates indicate better performance in mimicking human thought processes during word association tasks.

**Validation**: Initial findings highlighted model performance across different versions of LLMs
