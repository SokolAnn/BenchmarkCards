## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to evaluate LLMs‚Äô capacity to reason analytically in unseen foreign languages.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Language Model Evaluators
- Linguists

**Tasks**:
- Linguistic Reasoning

**Limitations**: The authors of the paper are not native speakers of the languages included, and there cannot be guaranteed accuracy of the sentences used.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated and curated by the authors specifically for this benchmark.

**Size**: 48 puzzles, 272 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Problems were test-solved and rated for difficulty by two International Linguistics Olympiad medalists.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Exact Match Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is computed based on exact matches for puzzle solutions.

**Interpretation**: Good performance is indicated by higher exact match accuracy.

**Validation**: Validated through evaluation against existing knowledge of the languages without training data leakage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Data Contamination

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Data contamination

**Demographic Analysis**: The choice of extremely low-resource languages aims to improve diversity in NLP evaluations, but bias in the selection process may exist.
