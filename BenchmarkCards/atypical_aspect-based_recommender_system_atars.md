# Atypical Aspect-based Recommender System (ATARS)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Atypical Aspect-based Recommender System (ATARS)

**Overview**: This paper introduces a new task of engineering serendipity in recommendations by promoting items with atypical aspects that match user interests. It presents an LLM-based system that extracts atypical aspects from reviews, estimates their user-specific utility, and ranks items to enhance user satisfaction through surprise and relevance.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop a recommender system that enhances user satisfaction by promoting items with atypical aspects that generate serendipitous experiences.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Recommendation Systems
- Information Extraction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Yelp reviews dataset containing approximately 5 million restaurant reviews, 190k hotel reviews, and 115k hair salon reviews.

**Size**: 5 million reviews

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts and crowd-sourced utility value annotations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Recall
- Precision

**Calculation**: Metrics were calculated based on the correlation between system-generated rankings and ground truth rankings for serendipity-based recommendations.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better alignment with user preferences and expectations, while lower scores suggest a mismatch between recommendations and user interests.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline models were evaluated against standard rankings without atypical aspect considerations.

**Validation**: Validation procedures involved assessing the correlation of the developed recommendation metrics against established benchmarks.
