## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a high-quality benchmark for evaluating models that assist in repairing Excel formulas and diagnosing errors.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Excel Formula Repair

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated seed samples from online forums and generated using a synthetic data generation pipeline.

**Size**: 618 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual verification and correction by annotators, supplemented by automated checks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Manual annotation
- LLM-based validation

**Metrics**:
