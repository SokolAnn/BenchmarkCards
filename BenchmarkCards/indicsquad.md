**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners
- Language Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Systematically translated and adapted from the SQuAD dataset.

**Size**: 118,516 training samples, 11,873 validation samples, 11,803 test samples for each language.

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Translated with linguistic fidelity and answer-span alignment techniques applied.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation using baseline performance metrics on QA tasks
- Comparison of monolingual and multilingual models

**Metrics**:
