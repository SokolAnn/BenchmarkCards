# SilVar (Speech-Driven Multimodal Model for Reasoning Visual Question Answering and Object Localization)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SilVar (Speech-Driven Multimodal Model for Reasoning Visual Question Answering and Object Localization)

**Overview**: SilVar is a novel end-to-end multimodal model that uses speech instructions for reasoning in visual question answering. This paper also introduces a dataset designed to challenge models with speech-based reasoning tasks for object localization.

**Data Type**: text, image, speech

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMMU
- ScienceQA

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To bridge the gap in human-machine interaction by enabling effective reasoning from both text and speech instructions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Object Localization
- Reasoning with Speech Instructions

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A unique speech instruction dataset consisting of text, images, and speech instructions, alongside text generation. Built upon existing reasoning datasets and benchmarks.

**Size**: 1,000 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Questions and answers verified by human reviewers, with bounding boxes manually labeled.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
