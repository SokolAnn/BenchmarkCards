## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive and diverse dataset for improving the automatic transformation of natural language to Signal Temporal Logic in cyber-physical systems.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Natural Language to Logic Transformation

**Limitations**: The dataset may not fully capture the temporal property patterns of real-world cyber-physical systems due to its reliance on LLM-generated data.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Manually created seed set of NL-STL pairs, enhanced through LLM augmentation.

**Size**: 16,000 samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts and LLM-generated pairs validated through human checks.
