## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To rigorously assess the cognitive reasoning abilities of AI models across multidisciplinary Olympic-level challenges.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Educational Institutions

**Tasks**:
- Cognitive Reasoning Evaluation

**Limitations**: Our benchmark inevitably introduces some noisy problems and is currently limited to evaluating models‚Äô abilities to solve complex problems.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collection of problems from 62 distinct Olympic competitions and publicly available URLs.

**Size**: 11,163 problems

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by approximately 30 students with backgrounds in science and engineering.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation
- Process-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on correctness of answers and correctness of reasoning steps.

**Interpretation**: Performance is evaluated not just on final accuracy but also on the correctness of the reasoning processes.

**Baseline Results**: Even advanced models like GPT-4o only achieve a 39.97% overall accuracy on the benchmark.

**Validation**: The benchmark incorporates data leakage detection experiments to ensure its effectiveness.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
