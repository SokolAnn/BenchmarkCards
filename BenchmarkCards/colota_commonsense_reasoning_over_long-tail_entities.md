## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the entity-based commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs in long-tail settings and improve KGQA methodologies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- KGQA Developers
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Commonsense Reasoning
- Knowledge Graph Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Queries formulated from existing entity-based commonsense reasoning datasets, specifically StrategyQA and CREAK.

**Size**: 3,300 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated with reasoning steps and knowledge graph facts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- FActScore
- Reasoning Score

**Calculation**: FActScore measures the percentage of atomic facts supported by a knowledge source. Reasoning Score assesses the validity of logical reasoning in the LLM responses.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in commonsense reasoning and factual accuracy.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Queries validated for factual knowledge supported by Wikidata.
