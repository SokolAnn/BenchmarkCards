**Data Type**: user statements with emotional context

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To construct a unified and objective benchmark for evaluating the emotional intelligence of LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Key Event Recognition
- Mixed Event Recognition
- Implicit Emotional Recognition
- Intention Recognition

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated user statements based on various life scenarios using GPT-4.

**Size**: 10,000 statements

**Format**: N/A
