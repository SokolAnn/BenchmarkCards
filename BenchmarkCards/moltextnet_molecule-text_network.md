# MolTextNet (Molecule-Text Network)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MolTextNet (Molecule-Text Network)

**Overview**: MolTextNet is a dataset of 2.5 million high-quality molecule-text pairs designed to support multimodal molecular learning. It overcomes limitations of existing datasets by providing structure, properties, and synthesis-related descriptions for each molecule.

**Data Type**: molecule-text pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare
- Chemistry

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- PubChem
- ChEBI

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuganghuggingface/moltextnet)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of MolTextNet is to advance foundational multimodal modeling in molecular science by providing high-quality data that enables effective training of graph-language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Chemists
- Pharmaceutical Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Property Prediction
- Structure Retrieval
- Molecule Generation from Text

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Molecule annotations sourced from ChEMBL35 combined with synthetic descriptions generated by GPT-4o-mini.

**Size**: 2,500,000 pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated using a synthetic text generation pipeline based on molecular annotations from ChEMBL.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Model-based evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated using classification and regression tasks that evaluate the performance of models pretrained on MolTextNet.

**Interpretation**: Higher AUC scores indicate better performance in distinguishing between active and inactive compounds in property prediction tasks.

**Baseline Results**: GIN encoder pretrained on MolTextNet-300K achieved the highest AUC scores across multiple classification tasks.

**Validation**: The model was validated using scaffold-based splits to ensure rigorous evaluation and generalization across molecular structures.
