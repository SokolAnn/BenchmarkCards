- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Synthetic generation using Wikipedia's Vital Articles with questions generated for both single-hop and multi-hop queries.

**Size**: 16,987 training samples, 1,197 testing samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotation includes thoughts, actions, and evidence feedback as part of the reasoning process.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Exact Match (EM)
