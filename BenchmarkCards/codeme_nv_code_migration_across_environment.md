# CODEME NV (Code Migration Across Environment)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CODEME NV (Code Migration Across Environment)

**Overview**: A benchmark designed to assess LLMs‚Äô abilities in code migration scenarios, encompassing 922 examples spanning 19 Python and Java packages, structured around three tasks: identifying version-incompatible functions, detecting changes in function definitions, and adapting code to target environments.

**Data Type**: code migration examples

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering

**Languages**:
- Python
- Java

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/xdshen-ai/Benchmark-of-Code-Migration)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically assess the code migration capabilities of LLMs across different environments.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Identifying Version-Incompatible Functions
- Answering Function Changes
- Code Migration

**Limitations**: CODEME NV is relatively small, particularly the Java dataset.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Official documentation and release notes of Python and Java packages containing function changes.

**Size**: 922 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually curated from official sources.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Agent-based Evaluation
- Unit Test-based Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Pass@1
- Pass@5
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the ability of LLMs to accurately identify incompatible functions and migration correctness.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better LLM performance in locating incompatible functions and performing successful migrations.

**Baseline Results**: Average accuracy across seven models shows a pass@1 rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4 O achieving a highest score of 43.84%.

**Validation**: Experimental evaluation with nine different LLMs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
