# FaLlacy Understanding Benchmark (FLUB)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FaLlacy Understanding Benchmark (FLUB)

**Overview**: FLUB contains cunning texts that are easy for humans to understand but difficult for models to grasp. It is designed to evaluate the fallacy understanding ability of LLMs through tasks such as Answer Selection, Cunning Type Classification, and Fallacy Explanation.

**Data Type**: cunning texts

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/THUKElab/FLUB)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To challenge the reasoning and understanding abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by evaluating their ability to understand cunning texts and fallacies.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Answer Selection
- Cunning Type Classification
- Fallacy Explanation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Cunning texts collected from the 'Ruozhiba' online forum.

**Size**: 834 samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated by native Chinese speakers with oversight from senior annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
