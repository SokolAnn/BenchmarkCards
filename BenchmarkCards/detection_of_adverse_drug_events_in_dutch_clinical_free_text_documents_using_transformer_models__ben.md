## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Detection of Adverse Drug Events in Dutch clinical free text documents using Transformer Models ‚Äì benchmark study

**Overview**: This study sets a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical scenarios, and fit-for-purpose performance measures.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- Dutch

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective is to benchmark various transformer models for adverse drug event detection in Dutch clinical free text documents, particularly clinical notes and discharge letters.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Named Entity Recognition
- Relation Classification

**Limitations**: The gold standard training corpus is small, containing 102 clinical notes.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Anonymized clinical free text documents from ICU progress notes and discharge letters in Dutch hospitals.

**Size**: 102 clinical progress notes

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Richly annotated by medical experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Micro-averaged F1 Score
- Macro-averaged F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall

**Calculation**: Micro and macro averaging metrics provide insights into model performance across different classes of ADEs.

**Interpretation**: Higher F1 scores indicate better performance in detecting ADEs, particularly the macro scores are more indicative in the context of imbalanced data.

**Baseline Results**: Micro-averaged F1 scores of ¬±0.983 for the best models on the Dutch ADE corpus, with MedRoBERTa.nl performing best overall.

**Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation was utilized for evaluation.
