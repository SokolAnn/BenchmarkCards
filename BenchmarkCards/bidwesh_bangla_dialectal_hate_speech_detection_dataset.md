# BIDWESH (Bangla Dialectal Hate Speech Detection Dataset)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BIDWESH (Bangla Dialectal Hate Speech Detection Dataset)

**Overview**: BIDWESH is the first multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type, and target group, providing a linguistically rich and inclusive resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla.
