## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To unify dialectal datasets across different tasks and to foster research on language varieties and non-standard dialects.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Dependency Parsing
- Parts-of-Speech Tagging
- Named Entity Recognition
- Dialect Identification
- Sentiment Analysis
