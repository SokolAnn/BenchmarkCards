# SimBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SimBench

**Overview**: SimBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of student large language models (S-LLMs) in generating digital twins (DTs) for simulators, enabling ranking based on their ability to produce high-quality DTs.

**Data Type**: dialogue interactions

**Domains**:
- Robotics
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To measure the ability of student large language models to generate effective digital twins for simulation scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Multi-turn Interaction
- Digital Twin Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A dataset with 102 exemplary demonstrations categorized into 34 distinct physical systems, manually curated by simulation experts.

**Size**: 102 demonstrations

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually curated by experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation using a rule-based judge LLM (J-LLM)

**Metrics**:
