**Data Type**: video-question-answer pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- BoLD (Body Language Dataset)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To validate whether VideoLLMs can correctly interpret emotions from body language in videos.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from the Body Language Dataset (BoLD) and designed for evaluation of VideoLLMs.

**Size**: 7,632 videos

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Crowdsourced annotation of emotions on a 10-point scale.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Performance metrics calculated based on the predictions made by VideoLLMs against the annotated categories.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better understanding of emotions expressed through body language.

**Validation**: Dataset validation involved human evaluation across various demographics.
