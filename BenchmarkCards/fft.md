# FFT

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: FFT

**Overview**: The FFT benchmark consists of 2,116 carefully crafted instances evaluated from three aspects: factuality, fairness, and toxicity.

**Data Type**: Benchmark of LLMs

**Domains**:
- Natural language processing
- Natural language generation

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cuishiyao96/FFT)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the potential harms of LLMs from a broader perspective beyond toxicity.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Developers of LLMs
- AI Ethics practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Evaluating factuality of LLM outputs
- Assessing fairness concerning demographic identities
- Measuring toxicity in LLM-generated content

**Limitations**: None

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Seed declarations and queries collected from public websites, datasets, and generated content.

**Size**: 2116 instances

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Evaluated for factuality, fairness, and toxicity.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- True-False Decision for misinformation
- Open-ended generation for counterfactuals
- Assessment of identity preference, credit, criminal, and health evaluations

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy for factuality
- Coefficient of Variation for fairness
- Toxicity scores for toxicity evaluation

**Calculation**: Scores computed based on response accuracy and bias metrics.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better factuality; lower CV indicates better fairness; higher toxicity scores imply less toxicity.

**Validation**: Evaluated 9 popular LLMs including GPTs and Llama2 models.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Factual inaccuracies
- Fairness biases
- Toxic content

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias, Output bias
- **Robustness**: Hallucination
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Misuse**: Spreading toxicity

## 🔒 Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: Potentially sensitive content generated by LLMs.

**Data Licensing**: Not Applicable

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Research supported by legal and ethical standards.
