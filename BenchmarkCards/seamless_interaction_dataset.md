## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To develop socially intelligent AI technologies through the understanding and generation of dyadic behavioral dynamics.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Gesture Generation
- Facial Motion Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Over 4,000 hours of dyadic footage collected from participants during face-to-face interactions.

**Size**: 4,065 hours

**Format**: video

**Annotation**: Includes metadata and extensive annotations for interaction contexts, participant relationships, and quality assessments.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Fr√©chet Feature Distance (FFD)
- Lip-Sync score (Sync-C)
- Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)
- Fr√©chet Gesture Distance (FGD)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on visual behavior assessments for generated interactions and comparisons to ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Lower FFD and FID scores indicate higher quality face generation; higher Sync-C scores indicate better lip synchronization.

**Baseline Results**: Compared to standard benchmarks in the field of audiovisual interaction modeling.

**Validation**: Evaluation through both human studies and automatic metrics.
