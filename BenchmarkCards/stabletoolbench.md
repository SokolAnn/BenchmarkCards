# StableToolBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: StableToolBench

**Overview**: StableToolBench is a newly proposed benchmark designed to enhance the stability of evaluations in tool learning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating a virtual API system and stable evaluation methods.

**Data Type**: API call scenarios

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ToolBench

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/StableToolBenchgeneral)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of StableToolBench is to provide a stable and scalable evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in utilizing external tools.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Tool Utilization

**Limitations**: The evaluation framework relies on GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator, which may increase costs.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated from the virtual API system and simulated environments.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics based on GPT-4
- Human evaluation for performance assessment

**Metrics**:
- Solvable Pass Rate (SoPR)
- Solvable Win Rate (SoWR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the performance of LLMs against evaluated tasks categorized as solvable or unsolvable.

**Interpretation**: Higher SoPR and SoWR indicate better tool utilization capabilities of LLMs.

**Validation**: Evaluation procedures are conducted with multiple model runs and analyzed for consistency.
