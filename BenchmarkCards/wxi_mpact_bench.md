# WXI MPACT BENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: WXI MPACT BENCH

**Overview**: The first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs on disruptive weather impacts, which includes two evaluation tasks: multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering.

**Data Type**: disruptive weather impact annotations and question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CLLMate

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Michaelyya/WXImpactBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the ability of large language models to understand disruptive weather impacts, aiding in climate change adaptation understanding.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Climate Scientists
- Policy Makers

**Tasks**:
- Multi-Label Classification
- Ranking-based Question Answering

**Limitations**: Potential biases in underrepresented historical events and linguistic variations.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Historical newspaper articles collected and processed through a multi-stage data construction pipeline.

**Size**: 350 historical articles, 1,386 mixed context articles

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated by domain experts following specific guidelines for impact categories.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Hit@1
- nDCG@5
- Recall@5
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on model predictions against ground-truth labels.

**Interpretation**: A higher score indicates better understanding of disruptive weather impacts by the models.

**Validation**: Extensive evaluation across various LLMs to benchmark their performance.
