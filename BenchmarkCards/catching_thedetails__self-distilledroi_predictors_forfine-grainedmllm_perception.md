# CATCHING THEDETAILS: SELF-DISTILLEDROI PREDICTORS FORFINE-GRAINEDMLLM PERCEPTION

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CATCHING THEDETAILS: SELF-DISTILLEDROI PREDICTORS FORFINE-GRAINEDMLLM PERCEPTION

**Overview**: We propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves the trade-off associated with fine-grained perception in multimodal large language models. The framework improves the model's visual understanding capabilities without requiring extensive supervision or full model fine-tuning.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
