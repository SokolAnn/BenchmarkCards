# MoralBench: Moral Evaluation of LLMs

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MoralBench: Moral Evaluation of LLMs

**Overview**: This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to measure and compare the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with datasets specifically curated to address a wide range of ethical dilemmas and scenarios reflective of real-world complexities.

**Data Type**: moral reasoning scenarios

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1k93YZJserYc2CkqP8d4B3M3sgd3kA8W7)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/agiresearch/MoralBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the moral identity of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a systematic analysis of their responses to ethical dilemmas.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Ethicists
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Moral Reasoning Evaluation

**Limitations**: This benchmark is currently English language-based, with uncertain performance on other languages.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated datasets based on Moral Foundations Theory, including the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and Moral Foundations Vignettes.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Data was generated based on moral foundations theory and structured formats for moral evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Binary Moral Assessment
- Comparative Moral Assessment

**Metrics**:
- Moral Alignment Score

**Calculation**: Scores are derived based on LLM responses compared to average human ratings.

**Interpretation**: High scores indicate strong alignment with human moral judgments while variability in scores indicates challenges in moral reasoning.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Experiments involving multiple LLMs conducted to evaluate moral reasoning capabilities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:

- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: N/A
