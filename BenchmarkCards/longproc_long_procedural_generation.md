# LONGPROC (Long Procedural Generation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LONGPROC (Long Procedural Generation)

**Overview**: LONGPROC is a new benchmark that consists of six diverse procedural generation tasks designed to evaluate long-context language models (LCLMs) on their ability to follow detailed procedural instructions, synthesize dispersed information, and generate structured long-form outputs.
