## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically and objectively evaluate the remote sensing capabilities of large vision-language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Change Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data collected manually from 50 globally distributed cities, using diverse satellite imagery and data sources.

**Size**: 10,507 problems

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Questions constructed from expert knowledge and model-driven generation with human verification.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)

**Calculation**: Accuracy is computed based on the correctness of responses to the multiple-choice questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance of the VLMs in tackling remote sensing tasks.

**Validation**: The benchmark is validated through thorough human review and systematic evaluation against multiple VLMs.
