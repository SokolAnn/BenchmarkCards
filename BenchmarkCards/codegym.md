**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated from coding problems

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Evaluation on benchmark tasks

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Average Reward

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the completion of tasks and the correctness of the answers submitted by the agents.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and greater population of task completion indicate stronger performance and generalizability of model agents.

**Baseline Results**: The baseline results are demonstrated through improvements in out-of-distribution accuracy for trained models.

**Validation**: Models are validated on held-out OOD benchmarks and in-domain performance.
