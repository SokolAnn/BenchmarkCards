# RIMO (Remade International Mathematical Olympiad)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: RIMO (Remade International Mathematical Olympiad)

**Overview**: RIMO is a two-track benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning by reformulating International Mathematical Olympiad problems into a deterministic format. It consists of RIMO-N, with 335 problems that allow for exact answer checking, and RIMO-P, featuring 456 proof problems with guided sub-problems for step-by-step reasoning evaluation.
