# Alpha Excel Benchmark

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Alpha Excel Benchmark

**Overview**: This study presents a novel benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) using challenges derived from the Financial Modeling World Cup (FMWC) Excel competitions. The benchmark provides a standardized framework for assessing LLM capabilities in realistic business-oriented tasks.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/reveondivad/certify/blob/main/excel_benchmark_with_answers_v14.json)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create a practical evaluation framework for measuring Large Language Models' capabilities on business-relevant tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Numerical Reasoning
- Pattern Recognition
- Problem-Solving
- Data Analysis

**Limitations**: The benchmark's translation from interactive spreadsheet challenges to text-based evaluations sacrifices elements of the original task environment.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Challenges derived from historical FMWC competitions.

**Size**: 113 challenges

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Challenges transformed into standardized JSON format for programmatic evaluation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
