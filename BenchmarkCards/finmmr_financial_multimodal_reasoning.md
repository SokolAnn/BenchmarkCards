# FinMMR (Financial Multimodal Reasoning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FinMMR (Financial Multimodal Reasoning)

**Overview**: FinMMR is a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in financial numerical reasoning tasks. It introduces three advancements: multimodality, comprehensiveness across 14 financial subdomains, and a challenge requiring multi-step numerical reasoning.
