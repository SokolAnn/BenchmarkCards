# JMedBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: JMedBench

**Overview**: We propose a new benchmark including eight LLMs across four categories and 20 Japanese biomedical datasets across five tasks to evaluate Japanese biomedical language models.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- Japanese

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- BLURB

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To construct a benchmark for evaluating Japanese biomedical LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Biomedical Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Multi-Choice Question Answering
- Named Entity Recognition
- Machine Translation
- Document Classification
- Semantic Text Similarity

**Limitations**: Due to budget limitations, we only translated several datasets of MCQA and NER and evaluated models with 7B/8B parameters.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 20 Japanese biomedical datasets including translations from English and original datasets.

**Size**: 38,130 samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Translations by Machine Translation and manual adjustments for dataset quality.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Manual evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- BLEU Score
- Pearson Correlation

**Calculation**: Calculated based on the results from various prompt templates across multiple runs.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in the respective tasks.

**Baseline Results**: Varied model performances across tasks reported in tables.

**Validation**: Extensive validation through multiple prompt templates and evaluation metrics.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
