## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from 11 existing public video datasets, including STAR, PAXION, and CLEVRER.

**Size**: 1.1 million video annotations

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatic annotation through large language models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- QA generation using automatic annotation
- Evaluation with multiple-choice QA

**Metrics**:
