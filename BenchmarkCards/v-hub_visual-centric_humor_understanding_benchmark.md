# v-HUB (Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: v-HUB (Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark)

**Overview**: v-HUB is a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark designed to assess the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor comprehension through visual cues. It contains a curated collection of short videos from silent films and user-generated content, with annotations for evaluation tasks including caption matching, humor explanation, and open-ended questions.
