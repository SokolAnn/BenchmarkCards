# JETTS (Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: JETTS (Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling)

**Overview**: The JETTS benchmark evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement.

**Data Type**: text

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-judges in test-time scaling scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Response Reranking
- Step-Level Beam Search
- Critique-Based Refinement

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Responses generated from multiple large language models trained for different tasks.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Responses were generated automatically without manual annotation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Normalized Helpfulness

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on judge performance across various tasks and datasets.

**Interpretation**: Positive normalized helpfulness means the judge aids in improving the model generation.

**Baseline Results**: Responses are compared against greedy decoding performance and random selection.

**Validation**: Performance is validated through comparisons with existing models and evaluations.
