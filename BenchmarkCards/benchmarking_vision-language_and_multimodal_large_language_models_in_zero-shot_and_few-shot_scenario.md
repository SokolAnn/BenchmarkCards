## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Benchmarking Vision-Language and Multimodal Large Language Models in Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Scenarios: A Study on Christian Iconography

**Overview**: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models and Vision Language Models in the task of single-label classification of Christian Iconography, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot settings across curated datasets.

**Data Type**: image

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision
- Digital Humanities

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ArtDL
- ICONCLASS

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To benchmark the performance of multimodal LLMs and VLMs for the classification of Christian iconography.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in Artificial Intelligence
- Digital Humanities Scholars

**Tasks**:
- Image Classification

**Limitations**: This study focuses on classifying single-labeled images with a limited number of classes; it does not reflect real-world scenarios.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: ArtDL, ICONCLASS dataset, Wikidata

**Size**: 42,500 images (ArtDL), 87,500 images (ICONCLASS), 718 images (Wikidata)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated with Iconclass codes and descriptions.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Zero-shot classification
- Few-shot learning

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Model accuracy is calculated based on the number of correct predictions over the total predictions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in classifying images accurately.

**Baseline Results**: ResNet50 achieved 84.44% accuracy as the baseline.

**Validation**: Cross-dataset consistency checks were performed.
