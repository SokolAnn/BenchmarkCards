# GUESS BENCH

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: GUESS BENCH

**Overview**: GUESS BENCH is a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on modeling pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human creativity through the Minecraft minigame 'Guess the Build'. It consists of 1500 curated images and 2000 problems designed to assess creativity sensemaking.
