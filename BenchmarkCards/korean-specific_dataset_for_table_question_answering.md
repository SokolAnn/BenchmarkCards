# Korean-Specific Dataset for Table Question Answering

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Korean-Specific Dataset for Table Question Answering

**Overview**: This paper introduces two Korean-specific datasets for the task of table question answering: Korean Wikipedia Tabular dataset and Korean Wikipedia Table Questions dataset, along with a pre-trained language model called KO-TaBERT.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Korean

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LG-NLP/KorWikiTableQuestions)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To construct datasets for Korean table question answering and train a corresponding pre-trained language model (KO-TaBERT).

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Table Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Korean Wikipedia dump and crowdsourced workers for question-answering data.

**Size**: 1.4M tables and 70k pairs of questions and answers

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Generated by crowdsourced workers considering various levels of question difficulty.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Exact Match (EM)
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: EM is calculated if the predicted answer matches the ground truth exactly; F1 Score calculates token overlaps between predicted and ground truth answers.

**Interpretation**: Higher EM and F1 scores indicate better performance in answering the questions correctly.

**Validation**: Evaluated on a test dataset consisting of subsets from KorQuAD 2.0 and the crowdsourced dataset.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
