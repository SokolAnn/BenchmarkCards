## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SwissDial: Parallel Multidialectal Corpus of Spoken Swiss German

**Overview**: SwissDial is the first annotated parallel corpus of spoken Swiss German across 8 major dialects, plus a Standard German reference. It provides a basic dataset for employing data-driven NLP applications in Swiss German.

**Data Type**: text and audio pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- German

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://projects.mtc.ethz.ch/swiss-voice-data-collection)
- [Resource](https://projects.mtc.ethz.ch/projects/swiss-voice/swissdial)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a basic dataset that would allow applicability of recent data-driven NLP models, especially for speech synthesis, and to step up the ongoing research in Swiss German.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Speech Synthesis
- Machine Translation
- Dialect Identification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data collected from web-crawled sentences in High German, manual translations into Swiss German dialects, and their audio recordings.

**Size**: 23,195 sentences

**Format**: text and audio files

**Annotation**: Manual translations and audio recordings by native speakers of each dialect.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Speech synthesis experiments
- Quality validation through MOS tests

**Metrics**:
- Mean Opinion Score (MOS)

**Calculation**: MOS ratings based on speech naturalness and quality evaluations by native speakers.

**Interpretation**: Higher MOS scores indicate better naturalness and quality in the speech synthesis.

**Validation**: Validation was conducted through speech synthesis experiments and mean opinion score testing.
