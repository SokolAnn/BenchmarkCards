## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of HUMOTO is to provide a comprehensive dataset for advancing realistic human-object interaction modeling across various research domains.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Robotics Researchers
- Animators

**Tasks**:
- Human-Object Interaction
- Motion Generation

**Limitations**: Due to motion capture suit size constraints, the dataset includes only a single performer, which may introduce bias.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Captured from a custom motion capture setup utilizing dual-Kinect cameras and a motion capture suit.

**Size**: 736 sequences, totaling 7,875 seconds of motion

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Textual annotations provided at multiple levels, including concise titles and detailed scripts for each sequence.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Multi-sensor capture
- Scene-driven LLM scripting

**Metrics**:
- Foot Sliding
- Jerk
- Motion Signal-to-Noise Ratio (MSNR)
- Contact Quality
- State Consistency

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated as per defined formulas in the methodology, providing insights into motion quality and interaction realism.

**Interpretation**: Lower foot sliding and jerk values indicate more natural motion, while MSNR values are used to compare motion quality against other datasets.

**Baseline Results**: Compared against other datasets like Mixamo, HUMOTO shows lower foot sliding and jerk, indicating high motion fidelity.

**Validation**: Licensed industry professionals verified the motion and annotations for quality assurance.
