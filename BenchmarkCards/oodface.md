# OODFace

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OODFace

**Overview**: OIDFace explores the OOD challenges faced by facial recognition models from two perspectives: common corruptions and appearance variations, systematically designed with 30 OOD scenarios across 9 categories. This results in three robustness benchmarks: LFW-C/V, CFP-C/V, and YTF-C/V, aimed at evaluating the robustness of face recognition systems against various OOD factors.
