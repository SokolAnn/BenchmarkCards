# CameraBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CameraBench

**Overview**: CameraBench is a novel benchmark for visual reasoning that evaluates the visual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through photography-related tasks, specifically identifying numerical camera settings.

**Data Type**: binary-choice questions with numerical camera settings

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
