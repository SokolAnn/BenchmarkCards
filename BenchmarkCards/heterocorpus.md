**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Gender Studies

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Gender bias text corpora
- Sexism detection datasets

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/juanmvsa/HeteroCorpus)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To identify and mitigate heteronormative language in NLP systems.

**Target Audience**:
- Research community
- NLP practitioners
- Gender studies researchers

**Tasks**:
- Heteronormative language detection
- Gender bias analysis
- NLP system evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Hate speech detection

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Twitter

**Size**: 7,265 tweets

**Format**: Annotated textual data

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by six annotators

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- SVM classification
