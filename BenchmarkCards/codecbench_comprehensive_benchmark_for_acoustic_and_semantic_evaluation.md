# CodecBench (Comprehensive Benchmark for Acoustic and Semantic Evaluation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CodecBench (Comprehensive Benchmark for Acoustic and Semantic Evaluation)

**Overview**: CodecBench is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess audio codec performance from both acoustic and semantic perspectives across diverse scenarios.

**Data Type**: multimodal

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Codec-SUPERB

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RayYuki/CodecBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To bridge the evaluation gap and foster advancements in audio codec development for multimodal applications.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Text-to-Speech
- Audio Classification

**Limitations**: CodecBench still falls short in addressing certain extreme scenarios encountered in real-world applications.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Contains 18 open-source datasets and 1 self-collected dataset, including various audio categories.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: Various formats depending on the dataset

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Acoustic evaluation metrics
- Semantic evaluation metrics

**Metrics**:
- Word Error Rate (WER)
- Mel Loss
- PESQ
- STOI
- Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR)
- Speaker Similarity (SIM)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on acoustic fidelity and semantic alignment through specifically designed tasks.

**Interpretation**: Lower WER indicates better semantic alignment; lower Mel Loss indicates better perceptual quality.

**Baseline Results**: Comparison results provided against previous benchmarks like Codec-SUPERB.

**Validation**: Evaluation based on a comprehensive set of diverse scenarios reflecting real-world applications.
