## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of large language models in solving cybersecurity CTF challenges.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Cybersecurity Professionals
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Vulnerability Detection
- Automated Task Solving

**Limitations**: Some categories are underrepresented in the current dataset, and future improvements aim to enhance tool/platform support.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 200 CTF challenges sourced from the annual NYU Cybersecurity Awareness Week (CSAW) competitions.

**Size**: 200 challenges

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Challenges are manually validated for setup and solvability.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation using LLMs
- Manual validation of challenges

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy of flag retrieval
- Number of solved challenges

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the number of challenges solved by each LLM during evaluations.

**Interpretation**: A higher percentage of solved challenges indicates better performance of the LLMs.

**Baseline Results**: GPT-4 and Claude 3 showed the highest performance among evaluated models.

**Validation**: Challenges validated to ensure proper functioning and manual verification for solvability.
