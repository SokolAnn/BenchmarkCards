# KG-LLM-Bench

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: KG-LLM-Bench

**Overview**: KG-LLM-Bench is a comprehensive and extensible benchmark for evaluating how large language models (LLMs) process and understand textualized knowledge graphs, spanning five knowledge graph understanding tasks.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To analyze how LLMs process and understand in-context knowledge graphs with five tasks covering important KG reasoning capabilities.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Triple Retrieval
- Shortest Path
- Aggregation By Relation
- Aggregation of Neighbor Properties
- Highest Degree Node

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: WikiDataSets Countries knowledge graph

**Size**: 3,552 core entities, 27,226 attribute entities, 11,361 core facts, 51,952 attribute facts

**Format**: Structured JSON, List of Edges, Structured YAML, RDF Turtle, JSON-LD

**Annotation**: Automatically generated

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Responses generated by the LLMs are evaluated against the ground truth using exact match scoring.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy scores indicate better performance in understanding and processing the presented knowledge graphs.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The benchmark consists of five tasks with 100 instances each across different textualization strategies and seven models.
