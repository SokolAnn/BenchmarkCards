# CLEGRV (Visual Graph Question Answering Dataset)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CLEGRV (Visual Graph Question Answering Dataset)

**Overview**: CLEGRV is a new dataset for benchmarking Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems that focus on images of graphs, particularly inspired by transit networks. The dataset enhances the existing CLEGR dataset by providing images and related questions that can be answered using the visual information provided.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark for evaluating VQA systems on images of graphs, specifically for questions related to transit networks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated images and questions derived from the existing CLEGR dataset.

**Size**: 3,000 question-answer pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Questions are derived from naturally occurring queries related to the graph images.
