## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the robustness of remote sensing foundation models under various image corruptions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Scene Classification
- Semantic Segmentation
- Object Detection
- Image Captioning
- Visual Question Answering
- Visual Grounding

**Limitations**: The benchmark does not include key modalities such as multispectral, hyperspectral, and SAR data.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: AID for scene classification, ISPRS Potsdam for semantic segmentation, DIOR for object detection, and VRSBench for image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding.

**Size**: 20,264 training images and 9,350 test images across multiple datasets

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotations include bounding boxes and classification labels.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
- Average Precision (AP)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model predictions against ground truth annotations.

**Interpretation**: Higher values indicate better model robustness and performance.

**Validation**: Results are validated through systematic experiments across multiple corruptions.
