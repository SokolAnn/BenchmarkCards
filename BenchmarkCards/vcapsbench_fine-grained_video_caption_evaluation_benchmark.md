## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive video caption evaluation framework that addresses fine-grained aspects of video content necessary for text-to-video generation and enhancements in video understanding.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Video Understanding Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Video Caption Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Composed of videos sourced from ten publicly available datasets including Panda-70M, Ego4D, BDD100K, Pixabay, Pexel, VIDGEN-1M, ChronomicBench, FineVideo, FunQA, and LiFT-HRA-20K.

**Size**: 5,677 videos and 109,796 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Multi-dimensional question-answer pairs generated via human correction and LLMs, focusing on video content details.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Contrastive QA-pairs analysis
- Automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large language models

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy (AR)
- Inconsistency Rate (IR)
- Coverage Rate (CR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on LLM responses to generated QA pairs, utilizing classified responses as Positive, Negative, or Unanswerable.

**Interpretation**: Higher AR indicates better caption accuracy, lower IR indicates more consistency in captions, and higher CR signifies greater coverage of relevant content.

**Baseline Results**: Evaluated against various vision-language models (VLMs) including Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview, GPT-4o, and others.

**Validation**: N/A

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
