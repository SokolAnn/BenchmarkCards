## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning abilities of LLMs as intelligent urban agents for diverse urban applications.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Urban Planners
- Data Scientists
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Spatiotemporal Understanding
- Forecasting
- Planning
- Reflection with Feedback

**Limitations**: Intended primarily for evaluation; systematic enhancement methods for LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities are underexplored.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed through diverse urban tasks in UAgentEnv and public datasets across geospatial and traffic data.

**Size**: 62,466 structured QA pairs

**Format**: json

**Annotation**: Automated and manually verified through urban scenario simulations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Fine-grained evaluation
- Structured question-answering

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Categorical Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the responses of LLMs to structured QA pairs across the established tasks in a standardized urban environment.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better reasoning abilities in spatiotemporal tasks; specific thresholds may indicate effective adaptation to urban contexts.

**Baseline Results**: Evaluation includes comparison against 13 leading LLMs across various reasoning tasks.

**Validation**: Extensive evaluations conducted through simulations of diverse urban tasks with controlled scenarios.
