# STEERINGCONTROL

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: STEERINGCONTROL

**Overview**: STEERINGCONTROL is a benchmark for evaluating representation steering methods across alignment objectives such as bias, harmful generation, and hallucination. It assesses steering effectiveness and behavioral entanglement through a dataset of safety-relevant primary and secondary behaviors.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate representation steering methods and their effectiveness on various alignment objectives while studying their unintended side effects on other behaviors.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Bias Evaluation
- Harmful Generation Evaluation
- Hallucination Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A collection of 17 datasets focusing on primary and secondary alignment behaviors.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Effectiveness
- Entanglement
