# Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE)

**Overview**: SAGE is an automated evaluation framework designed to measure higher-order social cognition in large language models (LLMs) by simulating human-like emotional changes and inner thought processes during interactions.

**Data Type**: supportive-dialogue scenarios

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Emobench
- Socialbench

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Tencent/DigitalHuman/tree/main/SAGE)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide an interpretable and rigorous tool for evaluating and tracking progress in the social and emotional capabilities of language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Emotional Support Conversation
- Social Cognition Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed dialogue scenarios and existing supportive dialogue contexts.

**Size**: 100 scenarios

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation
- Simulated user interaction

**Metrics**:
- Sentient emotion score
- Correlation with BLRI ratings

**Calculation**: The Sentient emotion score is calculated based on the simulated emotional trajectory and the agent's inner reasoning during dialogue.

**Interpretation**: Higher Sentient scores indicate better performance in empathetic engagement and social cognition.

**Baseline Results**: Top models showed significant performance gaps in social cognition metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of SAGE in evaluation.

**Validation**: The correlation between Sentient emotion scores and BLRI ratings validates the psychological fidelity of the evaluation framework.
