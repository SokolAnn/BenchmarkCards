## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the reliability and robustness of code generation by large language models and study the API misuse behaviors.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: 1208 coding questions collected from Stack Overflow involving 18 representative Java APIs.

**Size**: 1208 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated based on common API misuse patterns.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Static analysis using abstract syntax tree (AST)
