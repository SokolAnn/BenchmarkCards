# Importing Phantoms: Measuring LLM Package Hallucination Vulnerabilities

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: Importing Phantoms: Measuring LLM Package Hallucination Vulnerabilities

**Overview**: This paper detects and measures package hallucinations across multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, and Rust) for different tasks across different types of LLMs.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- English
- Python
- JavaScript
- Rust

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19012)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to analyze package hallucination behavior in LLMs and develop defensive strategies for securing AI-assisted software development.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers
- Security Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Security Testing

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Generated code and existing package repositories (e.g., NPM, PyPI, crates.io)

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Experiments with LLMs
- Statistical analysis

**Metrics**:
- Package Hallucination Rate (PHR)

**Calculation**: PHR is calculated as the proportion of model prompts resulting in at least one hallucinated package.

**Interpretation**: Lower PHR indicates better performance in avoiding hallucinations.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The results are validated using multiple iterations across different models and programming languages.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Security

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Robustness**: Hallucination

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: N/A
