## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a large-scale, high-quality instruction dataset to enhance the adaptability and performance of large language models in information extraction tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Named Entity Recognition
- Relation Extraction
- Event Extraction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The corpus was created by collecting and cleaning 33 existing datasets focused on information extraction tasks.

**Size**: 0.32B tokens

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Data was cleaned and standardized from various existing information extraction datasets.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Micro-F1

**Calculation**: Micro-F1 score is computed based on the extraction accuracy of identified entities and relationships in the output.

**Interpretation**: Higher Micro-F1 scores indicate better performance in extraction tasks, with improvements noted in zero-shot scenarios.

**Baseline Results**: The performance of models fine-tuned on the IEP ILE dataset demonstrated significant improvements over baseline models.

**Validation**: Models were validated against a range of unseen datasets to assess zero-shot generalization abilities.
