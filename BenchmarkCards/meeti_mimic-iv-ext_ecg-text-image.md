# MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image)

**Overview**: MEETI is the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models (LLMs). It is built upon MIMIC-IV-ECG and provides a unified framework for multimodal learning and interpretable reasoning about cardiac health.

**Data Type**: multimodal
