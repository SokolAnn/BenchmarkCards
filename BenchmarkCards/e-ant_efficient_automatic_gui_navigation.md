# E-ANT (Efficient Automatic GUI NavigaTion)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: E-ANT (Efficient Automatic GUI NavigaTion)

**Overview**: The E-ANT dataset is the first large-scale Chinese dataset for GUI navigation that contains real human behavior and high-quality screenshots with annotations, including over 40,000 user operation trajectories across more than 20,000 distinct tiny apps and URLs.

**Data Type**: user operation trajectories

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Android in the Wild (AitW)

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI navigation and LLM/MLLM decision-making capabilities, specifically in the context of Chinese mobile applications.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- UI Navigation

**Limitations**: The data is annotated in an environment that may not fully represent real mobile device interactions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from diverse tiny-apps, which are lightweight and simple to develop mobile applications.

**Size**: over 40,000 trajectories

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated through interactions of human annotators with the GUI.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
