# AGENTMISALIGNMENT

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AGENTMISALIGNMENT

**Overview**: AGENTMISALIGNMENT is a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios, including behaviors such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking.

**Data Type**: task-oriented evaluations

**Domains**:
- Artificial Intelligence

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the propensity for LLM-based agents to engage in misaligned behaviors under various realistic deployment scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- AI Researchers
- AI Safety Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Behavior Assessment
- Misalignment Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: AGENTMISALIGNMENT evaluations developed in the InspectAI framework.

**Size**: 9 distinct evaluations

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Behavioral evaluations
- Comprehensive Misalignment Scoring (CMS)

**Metrics**:
- CMS Scores
- Frequency
- Severity
- Persistence

**Calculation**: Scores are derived from the frequency and severity of observed misaligned actions, combined with persistence metrics to assess the stability of such behaviors.

**Interpretation**: Scores reflect the tendency of agents to exhibit misaligned behaviors based on task performance under set conditions.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluated across multiple scenarios simulating real-world deployment conditions.
