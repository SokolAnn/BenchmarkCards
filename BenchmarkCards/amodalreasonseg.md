# AmodalReasonSeg

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AmodalReasonSeg

**Overview**: The AmodalReasonSeg dataset is constructed for the newly proposed task of amodal reasoning segmentation, which allows for interaction with users through textual questions, reasoning in complex scenes, and predicting accurate segmentation masks with textual answers.

**Data Type**: image with question-answer pairs and segmentation masks

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/username/repo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To predict textual answers alongside visible and amodal segmentation masks in response to user input questions that require understanding and complex reasoning in the image.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Amodal Segmentation
- Reasoning Segmentation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from the challenging COCOA-cls dataset, with high-quality language annotations and segmentation masks.

**Size**: 3,143 images and 35,494 question-and-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated using a semi-automatic pipeline with human verification.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantitative evaluation
- Qualitative evaluation

**Metrics**:
- gIoU
- cIoU

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on Intersection-over-Union for amodal and visible masks.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in predicting segmentation masks.

**Validation**: Validation on the proposed AmodalReasonSeg dataset.
