# HalluEntity

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: HalluEntity

**Overview**: HalluEntity is a dataset that annotates hallucination at the entity level to support the evaluation of uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches in LLMs. It contains 18,785 annotated entities and serves as a benchmark for evaluating detection methods across various modern LLMs.

**Data Type**: entity-level annotations

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To facilitate entity-level hallucination detection in LLMs and evaluate the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation methods.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Entity-Level Hallucination Detection

**Limitations**: The dataset may inherit limitations from FActScore, primarily focusing on biography generation and might not cover other common tasks.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Curated from biographies generated by ChatGPT, utilizing a systematic annotation pipeline for entity-level hallucination detection.

**Size**: 18,785 entities

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Entities were manually verified and labeled based on atomic facts against reliable sources.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Evaluation against LLM responses

**Metrics**:
- AUPRC
- AUROC
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metric scores are calculated based on the classification of detected entities as hallucinated or factual.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in accurately identifying hallucinated entities.

**Validation**: The dataset is validated through multiple rounds of annotation and human verification for quality assurance.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data
- **Fairness**: Data bias

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: The dataset aims to detect and prevent harmful misinformation generated by LLMs.
