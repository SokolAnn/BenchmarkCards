## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark for multilingual audio-based toxicity detection across 30 languages.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Toxicity Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset consists of audio utterances labeled with toxicity, selected from speech transcriptions and annotated manually across multiple languages.

**Size**: 20,000 utterances for English and Spanish, 4,000 utterances for each of the other 28 languages

**Format**: Audio files

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by professional annotators

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall
- Area Under the Curve (AUC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on performance comparisons between the MuTox classifier and existing text-based classifiers.

**Interpretation**: Higher F1 Scores and AUC values indicate better performance in toxicity detection.

**Baseline Results**: MuTox improves F1-Score over wordlist-based classifiers by an average of 100%.

**Validation**: The effectiveness of the MuTox dataset and classifier was validated through performance comparisons with text-based toxicity detectors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Safety

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Decision bias
- **Robustness**: Evasion attack

**Demographic Analysis**: The dataset includes a diverse set of speakers across different languages, which may contribute to varying perceptions of toxicity.

**Potential Harm**: Potential for misclassifying non-toxic content as toxic, leading to unintended bias in the classifier's performance.

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: N/A - Data collection procedures are compliant with ethical guidelines.

**Data Licensing**: Not Applicable

**Consent Procedures**: Annotators were informed of the content and could opt-out.
