# A NOVEL OPHTHALMIC BENCHMARK FOR EVALUATING MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH FUNDUS PHOTOGRAPHS AND OCT IMAGES

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: A NOVEL OPHTHALMIC BENCHMARK FOR EVALUATING MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH FUNDUS PHOTOGRAPHS AND OCT IMAGES

**Overview**: This benchmark introduces a novel multimodal dataset focused on ophthalmology, utilizing fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images to evaluate the diagnostic performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark addresses limitations in existing MLLM benchmarks, which often do not capture real-world complexities, by providing a dataset curated through rigorous quality control and expert annotation.

**Data Type**: fundus photographs and OCT images
