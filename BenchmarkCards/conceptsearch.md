# ConceptSearch

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ConceptSearch

**Overview**: ConceptSearch is a novel function-search algorithm that leverages LLMs for program generation and employs a concept-based scoring method to guide the search efficiently, aimed at solving tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC).

**Data Type**: program generation tasks

**Domains**:
- Artificial Intelligence

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enhance search efficiency and performance in solving tasks from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus using a function-search algorithm.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Program Synthesis
- Abstraction and Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) contains tasks designed to evaluate general-purpose intelligence with input-output pairs.

**Size**: 50 tasks

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Function Search Algorithm
- LLM-based Program Generation

**Metrics**:
- Task Success Rate

**Calculation**: Task success is measured as the fraction of tasks successfully solved, and efficiency is measured by the number of iterations required to find a solution.

**Interpretation**: Performance is interpreted based on the accuracy of tasks solved and efficiency in terms of iterations taken.

**Baseline Results**: Traditional methods achieved a success of 13/50 tasks, while ConceptSearch achieved 29/50 tasks.

**Validation**: ConceptSearch's performance evaluated against conventional methods.
