## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To advance emotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs through a unified benchmark with tailored evaluation metrics.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Fine-grained Emotion Recognition
- Basic Emotion Recognition
- Sentiment Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Sourced from the unlabeled parts of MER2024 with explicit permission from dataset owners.

**Size**: 115,595 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Model-led, human-assisted annotation strategy.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Hit Rate
- Weighted Average F-score (WAF)
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Hit Rate is calculated based on whether the true emotion label is included in the predicted labels from MLLM outputs.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance and recognition of emotional states.

**Baseline Results**: N/A
