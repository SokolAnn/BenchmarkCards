## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To support algebra educators in better identifying misconceptions and errors in the classroom.

**Target Audience**:
- Educators
- Researchers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Misconception Identification
- Diagnostic Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed from 145 peer-reviewed journal manuscripts and educator feedback.
