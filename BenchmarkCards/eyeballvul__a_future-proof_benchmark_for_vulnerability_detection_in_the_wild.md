# eyeballvul: a future-proof benchmark for vulnerability detection in the wild

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: eyeballvul: a future-proof benchmark for vulnerability detection in the wild

**Overview**: eyeballvul is a benchmark designed to test the vulnerability detection capabilities of language models at scale, sourced and updated weekly from published vulnerabilities in open-source repositories.

**Data Type**: list of revisions with associated vulnerabilities

**Domains**:
- Computer Security

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eyeballvul)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark for evaluating the vulnerability detection capabilities of language models in real-world scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Cybersecurity Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Vulnerability Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Sourced from the stream of published vulnerabilities in open-source repositories including CVEs.

**Size**: 55GB

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated from the known vulnerabilities present at each revision.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- LLM-based scoring

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Scores are computed based on the comparison of possible leads returned by the model to the known vulnerabilities for each revision.

**Interpretation**: Higher precision and recall indicate better performance in detecting vulnerabilities that match the ground truth.

**Baseline Results**: Best precision achieved was 19.6% and best recall was 14.1%.

**Validation**: The benchmark is updated weekly to remain current with published vulnerabilities.
