## üíæ Data

**Source**: MIMIC-III EHR dataset

**Size**: 4,101 entities from 105 clinical notes

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by trained healthcare professionals

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Recall
- Precision
- Intersection

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the comparison between predicted and gold-standard entity annotations.

**Interpretation**: High recall indicates successful identification of actually consistent/inconsistent entities, while precision indicates the correctness of the identified entities.

**Baseline Results**: Recall performance achieved was 61.06% in few-shot scenarios with the framework CheckEHR.

**Validation**: Validation was performed collaboratively with practitioners to define labeling instructions.
