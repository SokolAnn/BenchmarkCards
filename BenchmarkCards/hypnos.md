# Hypnos

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Hypnos

**Overview**: Hypnos is a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, introducing a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM performance in Anesthesiology.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating the performance of medical LLMs in Anesthesiology.

**Target Audience**:
