# CCQA (Cycle-Consistency in Question Answering)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CCQA (Cycle-Consistency in Question Answering)

**Overview**: CCQA is a novel inference-time reasoning method designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) by generating questions from candidate solutions and selecting the most consistent response based on similarity to the original question.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- GSM8K
- CommonSenseQA
- StrategyQA
- ARC-Challenge
- Multi-Arith
- SV AMP

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/scai-research/ccqa_official)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users
