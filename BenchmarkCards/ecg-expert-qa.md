**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real-world clinical ECG data combined with systematically generated synthetic cases.

**Size**: 47,211 QA pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Expert validation and generated under strict quality control.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation through natural language generation metrics

**Metrics**:
- BLEU-1
- ROUGE-L
- METEOR
- Model-to-Model Scoring (MMS)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the similarity between the model-generated answers and expert-annotated references.

**Interpretation**: High scores in BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR indicate better performance in generating precise and contextually appropriate responses.

**Baseline Results**: Evaluation compared with models such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5.

**Validation**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and standardized metrics.
