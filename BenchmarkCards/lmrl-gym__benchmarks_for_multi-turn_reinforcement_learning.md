**Name**: LMRL-Gym: Benchmarks for Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning

**Overview**: Our paper introduces the LMRL-Gym benchmark for evaluating multi-turn RL for LLMs, consisting of 8 different language tasks that cover a range of tasks in open-ended dialogue and text games and require multiple rounds of language interaction.

**Data Type**: language tasks with multiple turns of interaction

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Dialogue-based RL benchmarks
- Text-based game benchmarks

**Resources**:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/abdulhaim/LMRL-Gym)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enable RL algorithm researchers to benchmark and iterate on developing better RL methods for multi-turn language-based interaction tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Reinforcement Learning Developers

**Tasks**:
- Multi-Turn Dialogue
- Strategic Decision Making
- Information Gathering
- Negotiation

**Limitations**: The benchmark primarily uses smaller GPT-based LLMs to generate datasets, making it less applicable for larger-scale applications.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic datasets generated using LLMs through simulations of conversational interactions and text-based games.

**Size**: 800,000 interactions across 8 different tasks

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated from LLM interactions and datasets.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Online Reinforcement Learning
- Offline Reinforcement Learning
- Behavioral Cloning

**Metrics**:
- Normalized Reward
- Success Rate

**Calculation**: Rewards are calculated based on the performance of agents in completing tasks within defined constraints.

**Interpretation**: Higher rewards indicate better performance in achieving task objectives.

**Baseline Results**: Online PPO consistently outperformed offline value-based methods across various tasks, indicating significant gaps in performance.

**Validation**: Benchmarks validated through systematic tests against multiple RL algorithms.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
