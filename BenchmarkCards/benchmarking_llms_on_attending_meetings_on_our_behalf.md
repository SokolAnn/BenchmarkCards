# Benchmarking LLMs on Attending Meetings on Our Behalf

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Benchmarking LLMs on Attending Meetings on Our Behalf

**Overview**: We develop a prototype LLM-powered meeting delegate system and create a comprehensive benchmark using real meeting transcripts, assessing LLM performance in various scenarios.

**Data Type**: meeting transcripts

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04376)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as meeting delegates, specifically in terms of their ability to engage accurately in meetings.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Meeting Participation Evaluation
- Transcription Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Original meeting transcripts from the ELITR Minuting Corpus, comprising de-identified project meeting transcripts.

**Size**: 846 test cases

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Manually verified by two authors after initial generation by GPT-4.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Response Rate
- Recall
- Attribution

**Calculation**: Response Rate calculates the percentage of responses generated by the LLMs against the total expected responses.

**Interpretation**: A higher Response Rate indicates better performance of the meeting delegate system.

**Baseline Results**: GPT-4o demonstrated the highest performance across almost all tested categories.

**Validation**: Tested and evaluated through real-world scenarios and automated metric calculations.
