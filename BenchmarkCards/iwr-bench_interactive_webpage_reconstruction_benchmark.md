## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the ability of models to reconstruct interactive webpages based on user interaction videos.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Webpage Reconstruction
- Code Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated tasks from real-world websites with interaction videos and static assets.

**Size**: 113 tasks

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Tasks were annotated by experts with detailed action sequences and logical assertions.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Interactive Functionality Score (IFS)
