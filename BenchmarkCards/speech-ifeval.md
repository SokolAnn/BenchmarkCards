# Speech-IFEval

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: Speech-IFEval

**Overview**: Speech-IFEval is an evaluation framework designed to assess instruction-following capabilities and quantify catastrophic forgetting in speech-aware language models (SLMs).

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kehanlu/Speech-IFEval)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of SLMs and systematically measure the impact of catastrophic forgetting during their development.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Closed-ended questions, creative writing, and chain-of-thought tasks sourced from established speech-instruction benchmarks.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Instruction-Following Rate (IFrate)

**Calculation**: The IFrate is calculated as the average following rate across three task categories.

**Interpretation**: Higher IFrate indicates a model’s stronger capability to follow directives accurately.

**Validation**: N/A
