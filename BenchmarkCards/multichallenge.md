# MultiChallenge

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MultiChallenge

**Overview**: MultiChallenge is a pioneering benchmark evaluating large language models (LLMs) on conducting multi-turn conversations with human users, focusing on realistic challenges in human-LLM interactions.

**Data Type**: multi-turn conversation history with user instructions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MT-Bench
- MT-Eval

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the multi-turn conversational capabilities of large language models and to identify their challenges in engaging with human users.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Multi-turn Conversation Evaluation
- Question Answering
- Instruction Following

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic data generated through a multi-agent system and human-reviewed.

**Size**: 273 test examples

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by human experts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- LLM as judge with instance-level rubrics

**Metrics**:
- Average Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the responses of LLMs to user prompts across various challenge categories within the benchmark.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in respect to multi-turn conversation challenges.

**Baseline Results**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved an average accuracy of 41.4% on MultiChallenge.

**Validation**: Evaluation methods are validated through comparison with human-rated outcomes.
