# MULTITuDE (Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MULTITuDE (Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection Benchmark)

**Overview**: MULTITuDE is a novel benchmarking dataset for multilingual machine-generated text detection comprising of 74,081 authentic and machine-generated texts in 11 languages generated by 8 multilingual LLMs.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Arabic
- Catalan
- Chinese
- Czech
- Dutch
- English
- German
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Spanish
- Ukrainian

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://zenodo.org/records/10013755)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kinit-sk/mgt-detection-benchmark)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation of machine-generated text detection methods in multilingual settings.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Machine Generated Text Detection

**Limitations**: The dataset is limited by the selection of languages and the corresponding training samples used.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The human texts are sourced from the MassiveSumm dataset and machine-generated texts are produced by various LLMs.

**Size**: 74,081 texts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human texts classified as authentically written vs. machine-generated.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Fine-tuned detectors
- Statistical detectors
- Black-box detectors

**Metrics**:
- Macro F1 Score
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- AUC ROC

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model predictions over the test data.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in distinguishing machine-generated texts from human-written texts.

**Validation**: Detected methods were validated on datasets comprising authentic and machine-generated texts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Accuracy
- Fairness
- Privacy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Privacy**: Personal information in data

**Demographic Analysis**: The dataset includes various languages, though there is a bias toward Indo-European languages.

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: The dataset primarily uses publicly available texts and does not intentionally collect personal data.

**Data Licensing**: Usage is for non-commercial research, respecting copyright on sourced texts.

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Not Applicable
