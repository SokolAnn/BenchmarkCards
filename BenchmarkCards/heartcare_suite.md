## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To establish a unified and scalable framework for evaluating and improving ECG understanding in medical applications using multimodal instruction datasets and benchmarks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Medical Professionals

**Tasks**:
- Closed Question Answering
- Open Question Answering
- Report Generation
- Signal Prediction

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Heartcare-220K dataset, including ECG signals and clinical report images collected from public hospitals and existing ECG datasets.

**Size**: 220,000 ECG examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated annotation using a multi-agent data engine and expert review for clinical relevance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- ROUGE-L

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on performance against predefined clinical tasks like diagnosis classification and waveform analysis.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and F1 scores indicate better model performance across ECG related tasks, with clinical correctness as a primary concern.

**Baseline Results**: HeartcareGPT shows superior performance compared to existing models like MedVLM and Claude-3.5 on various ECG tasks.

**Validation**: Evaluation is conducted using a multi-dimensional framework tailored for specific ECG tasks.
