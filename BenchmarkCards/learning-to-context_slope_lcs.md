# Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS)

**Overview**: LCS quantifies the effectiveness of in-context learning (ICL) by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input relevance), addressing reliability and attribution issues in performance-based metrics.

**Limitations**: The current experimental datasets and models are limited.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Multiple datasets including GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, ARC-Challenge, MMLU-Pro, FinQA, and Amazon Review.

**Size**: 8 datasets used for experiments

**Format**: Various, depending on the dataset

**Annotation**: Synthetic evaluations and task-specific demonstrations.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Synthetic evaluation
- Demonstration selection

**Metrics**:
- Correlation with performance improvement

**Calculation**: The slope is calculated based on the relationship between learning gain and contextual relevance.

**Interpretation**: High LCS indicates effective ICL; low LCS suggests limited learning from demonstrations.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets to validate the correlation of LCS with task performance.
