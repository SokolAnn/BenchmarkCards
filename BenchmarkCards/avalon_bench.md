## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate multi-agent LLM Agents in the context of the social deduction game Resistance Avalon.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Game Developers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Multi-Agent Decision Making
- Game Strategy Evaluation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Game interactions between LLM agents and rule-based bots.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Benchmarking against rule-based bots
- Multi-agent interaction simulation

**Metrics**:
- Win rate
- Deduction accuracy

**Calculation**: Win rates are calculated based on the outcomes of games played by LLM agents against deterministic rule-based bots.

**Interpretation**: A higher win rate indicates better performance and strategic capabilities of the LLM agents in the game.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline results indicate that LLM agents like ChatGPT achieved a win rate of 22.2% in good-role and 66.7% in evil-role against naive bots.

**Validation**: Evaluations based on game outcomes and decision-making capabilities observed during game play.
