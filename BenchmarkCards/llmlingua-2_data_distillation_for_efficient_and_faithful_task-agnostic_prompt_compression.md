# LLMLingua-2 (Data Distillation for Efficient and Faithful Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLMLingua-2 (Data Distillation for Efficient and Faithful Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression)

**Overview**: This paper presents LLMLingua-2, a task-agnostic prompt compression method that utilizes a data distillation approach to derive knowledge from an LLM (GPT-4) for better performance in prompt compression. The method produces an extractive text compression dataset and evaluates the effectiveness of the approach across multiple benchmarks.
