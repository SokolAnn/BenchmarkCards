## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate awareness in large language models to ensure ethical integration into societal frameworks.

**Target Audience**:
- Artificial Intelligence Researchers
- Psychologists
- Philosophers

**Tasks**:
- Evaluating awareness dimensions
- Assessing LLMs' understanding of self-awareness and social interactions

**Limitations**: None

## üíæ Data

**Source**: AWARE EVAL dataset

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: Binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions

**Annotation**: Human-AI collaboration in dataset generation and quality evaluation

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluation based on psychological theories
- Human-AI collaborative dataset creation
- LLM-as-a-judge for quality evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Human alignment
- Quality of response

**Calculation**: Accuracy calculated as the ratio of correctly answered questions to the total number of questions.

**Interpretation**: Evaluate LLMs' understanding and adherence to human values in responses.

**Baseline Results**: Most LLMs scored below 80% accuracy across awareness dimensions.

**Validation**: Human assessment alongside LLM-generated evaluations
