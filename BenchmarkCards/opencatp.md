# OpenCATP

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OpenCATP

**Overview**: OpenCATP is the first dataset for cost-aware planning, comprising 11,100 evaluation samples from diverse tasks, allowing for quantitative evaluation of task performance and execution costs through the Quality of Plan (QoP) metric.

**Data Type**: task-performance evaluation samples

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English
- German

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation for cost-aware tool planning using large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Image Captioning
- Object Detection
- Machine Translation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: OpenCATP dataset created from various tasks based on cost-aware planning requirements.

**Size**: 11,100 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually annotated based on task performance and execution costs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Reinforcement Learning

**Metrics**:
- Quality of Plan (QoP)
- Execution Time

**Calculation**: QoP is calculated by combining task performance and execution costs using a weighted formula.

**Interpretation**: Higher QoP indicates a better balance between performance and costs.

**Validation**: The evaluation is validated through extensive experimental comparisons with existing methods.
