# SentiQNF (Sentiment Analysis using Quantum Algorithms and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SentiQNF (Sentiment Analysis using Quantum Algorithms and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems)

**Overview**: This study proposes a novel hybrid approach for sentiment analysis called Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (QFNN), which leverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the limitations of classical sentiment analysis algorithms. It was tested on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), demonstrating quantifiable performance improvements.

**Limitations**: This research is presently restricted by the utilization of a binary dataset, thereby constraining the application of models to multi-class datasets.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Tested on two datasets: Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD).

**Size**: 1000 training examples, 500 testing examples

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Sentiment labels were assigned as positive or negative during the preprocessing of datasets.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantum Neural Network (QNN)
- Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN)
- Hybrid Fuzzy Neural Network (HFNN)

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Recall
- Precision
