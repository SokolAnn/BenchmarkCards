# FLUX-Reason-6M & PRISM-Bench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FLUX-Reason-6M & PRISM-Bench

**Overview**: FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions designed to teach complex reasoning. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct tracks for evaluating text-to-image models.
