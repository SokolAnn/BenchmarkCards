## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To construct a high-quality, manually labeled dataset for lyric emotion attribution and evaluate the capabilities of various language models in predicting emotional intensity.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Emotion Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed via manual annotation using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) method by a committee of human annotators.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts using the MOS methodology.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Calculation**: MAE and RMSE were calculated to evaluate model performance in predicting emotional intensity scores.

**Interpretation**: Lower MAE and RMSE values indicate better predictive accuracy in estimating emotional intensity.

**Baseline Results**: Fine-tuned models achieved lower MAE and RMSE values compared to zero-shot models.

**Validation**: Models were validated based on their predictive accuracy across all six emotions.
