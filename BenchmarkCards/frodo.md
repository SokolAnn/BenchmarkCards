# FRODO

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: FRODO

**Overview**: FRODO is a framework designed to improve the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning in language models by generating correct reasoning steps and reliably reasoning over them.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://debjitpaul.github.io/reasoningmatter)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve the reasoning capabilities of small-sized language models by ensuring generated reasoning chains are correct and faithfully used.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: FRODO's methodology is dependent on rationales generated by larger language models, and additional counterfactual data may be costly and time-consuming to generate.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Generated reasoning chains from various reasoning tasks including StrategyQA, GSM8K, and others.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated reasonings from larger LLMs based on prompting.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Causal mediation analysis
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is computed based on the effectiveness of reasoning chains in producing correct answers in comparison to counterfactual reasoning chains.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better alignment between reasoning chains and final answers.

**Validation**: The framework was validated using multiple model backbones and across various reasoning tasks.
