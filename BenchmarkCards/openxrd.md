# OPENXRD

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OPENXRD

**Overview**: OPENXRD is an open-book pipeline designed for crystallography question answering, integrating textual prompts with concise supporting content generated by GPT-4. This framework uses a dataset consisting of 217 expert-level XRD questions to evaluate different vision-language models. The results show significant accuracy improvements for models utilizing GPT-4.5-generated summaries, especially those with limited prior training in crystallography.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs
