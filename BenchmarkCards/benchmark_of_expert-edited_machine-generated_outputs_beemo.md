# Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo)

**Overview**: Beemo includes 19.6k texts, composed of 6.5k human-written texts and 13.1k machine-generated & LLM-edited texts, designed for evaluating machine-generated text detection in various scenarios.

**Data Type**: text

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the detection of machine-generated texts, particularly those that have been edited by experts or LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- AI Safety Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Machine Generated Text Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset comprises texts collected and edited from a variety of instruction-finetuned LLMs and human-written content as prompts.

**Size**: 19,683 texts

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Expert annotators edited the machine-generated texts based on guidelines for accuracy, coherence, and fluency.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)

**Calculation**: AUROC scores are calculated based on the probability that a detector assigns higher scores to a randomly selected machine-generated text than to a randomly selected human-written text.

**Interpretation**: Higher AUROC values indicate better performance of the machine-generated text detectors.

**Validation**: The benchmark has been evaluated using 33 different configurations of MGT detectors.
