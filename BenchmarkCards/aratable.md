## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of AraTable is to provide a framework for evaluating LLMs on Arabic tabular data processing, specifically aimed at enhancing the understanding of reasoning and cognitive capabilities of models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Direct Question Answering
- Fact Verification
- Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset consists of Arabic tabular data collected from various sources including Wikipedia, real-world data from platforms such as Kaggle and government portals, and LLM-generated tables.

**Size**: 615 human-validated QA pairs

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated by comparing LLM responses to ground-truth answers validated by human annotators.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better model understanding and reasoning ability over Arabic tabular data.

**Baseline Results**: The evaluation shows that DeepSeek-V3 performed best across question types, while Jais models struggled.

**Validation**: Multi-round human evaluation and an assisted self-deliberation mechanism are used for accuracy validation.
