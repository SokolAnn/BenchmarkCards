## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate whether LLMs understand and express taarof norms in open-ended interactions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Data derived from cultural practices and validated scenarios by native speakers.
