## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a publicly available dataset of labeled CTPA reports to improve PE detection and enhance research in the field of hemostasis and thrombosis.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: MIMIC-IV database

**Size**: 19,942 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually labeled by two physicians and verified using a transformer language model

## üî¨ Methodology
