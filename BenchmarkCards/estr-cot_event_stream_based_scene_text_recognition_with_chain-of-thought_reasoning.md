# ESTR-CoT (Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ESTR-CoT (Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning)

**Overview**: The ESTR-CoT framework improves both the accuracy and interpretability of scene text recognition by integrating chain-of-thought reasoning within event stream inputs, producing both recognition results and reasoning processes.

**Data Type**: image-reasoning pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- EventSTR
- WordArt
- IC15

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To propose a novel reasoning-based framework for event stream scene text recognition that enhances model interpretability and accuracy.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Scene Text Recognition

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Constructed via a three-stage process involving generation, polishing, and expert verification.

**Size**: 16,222 image-reasoning pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Expert verification and structured multi-stage dataset curation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- BLEU-1
