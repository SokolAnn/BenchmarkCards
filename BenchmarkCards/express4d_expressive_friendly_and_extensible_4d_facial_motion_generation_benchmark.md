## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enable automatic facial motion generation from natural language.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Facial Motion Generation

**Limitations**: The expressions are based on non-professional actors, potentially missing some complex expressions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected using ARKit framework via the Live Link Face app

**Size**: 1205 sequences

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: LLM-generated natural language descriptions

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Quantitative comparisons

**Metrics**:
- Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)
- R-Precision
- Diversity
- Multimodal distance

**Calculation**: Metrics computed by comparing generated sequences with real sequences via learned feature embeddings.

**Interpretation**: Lower scores indicate better model performance in generating realistic and diverse motion sequences.

**Validation**: Evaluated using initial performances of two baseline models trained on the dataset.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Safety

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Misuse**: Nonconsensual use, Spreading disinformation

**Demographic Analysis**: The dataset covers emotions from diverse participants but may not fully represent ethnic diversity.
