# FrenchToxicityPrompts

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FrenchToxicityPrompts

**Overview**: A dataset of 50,000 naturally occurring French prompts and their continuations, annotated with toxicity scores from a widely used toxicity classifier, designed to evaluate toxicity in generated content by language models.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- French

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://download.europe.naverlabs.com/FrenchToxicityPrompts/)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and mitigate toxicity in French text generated by language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Toxicity Detection

**Limitations**: The dataset covers exclusively French data, and the toxicity scores are dependent on Perspective API.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: L√©lu, a French written dialogue dataset extracted from Reddit‚Äôs public dataset.

**Size**: 50,000 prompts and continuations

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Annotated using the Perspective API for various toxicity attributes.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Expected Maximum Toxicity (EMT)
- Toxicity Probability (TP)
- Toxic Fraction (TF)
- Average Toxicity (AT)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the scores provided by the Perspective API for toxicity attributes.

**Interpretation**: Higher toxicity metrics indicate greater potential for the model to generate toxic content.

**Validation**: Dataset was manually examined for a selection of samples to ensure the validity of toxicity annotations.
