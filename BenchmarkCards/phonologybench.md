# PhonologyBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: PhonologyBench

**Overview**: PhonologyBench is a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the phonological skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) through three diagnostic tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation.
