## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluating prompt injection detectors in realistic deployment scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Prompt Injection Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from open-source datasets and prompt injection attack strategies, including Ultrachat, LMSYS, Alpaca, and others.

**Size**: 20,000 examples

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Manually curated and automatically generated based on existing strategies.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Binary classification
- Fine-tuning on curated data
- Validation using distinct data splits

**Metrics**:
- Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)
- True Positive Rate (TPR) at low False Positive Rates (FPR)

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated based on the model's performance on the evaluation split, focusing on TPR at various FPR thresholds.

**Interpretation**: High TPR at low FPR thresholds indicates effective detection performance; the goal is to achieve low FPRs while maintaining high TPR.

**Baseline Results**: Performance of prior detectors such as PromptGuard, which shows significant improvement with the PromptShield detector.

**Validation**: Detectors are validated through training/evaluation splits that do not overlap, ensuring robust performance assessment.
