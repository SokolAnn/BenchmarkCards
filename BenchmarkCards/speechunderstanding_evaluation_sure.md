# SpeechUndeRstanding Evaluation (SURE)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SpeechUndeRstanding Evaluation (SURE)

**Overview**: We introduce the SpeechUndeRStanding Evaluation ( SURE ) benchmark for parameter-efficient learning for various speech-processing tasks.

**Data Type**: audio (speech recordings with associated labels, transcripts, speaker identifiers; mel-spectrograms)

**Domains**:
- Speech Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- SUPERBbenchmark

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Provide an effective setup of state-of-the-art parameter-efficient approaches for different speech processing tasks and introduce the SURE benchmark to examine the capability of Adapter tuning, Prefix tuning, and LoRA (and to evaluate the proposed ConvAdapter).

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Speech Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Speech Emotion Recognition
- Speaker Recognition
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Phoneme Recognition
- Intent Classification
- Slot Filling
- Text-To-Speech
- Keyword Spotting

**Limitations**: Performance is sub-par on some datasets (e.g., MELD which is multimodal and when only single modality is used). ConvAdapter ASR and SF results require further tuning for optimal hyperparameters. TTS quality can degrade for longer sentences; room for improvement noted.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Datasets included in SURE as listed in Table 1: ESD, MELD, VCTK, FLEURS, LibriSpeech (LS), Fluent Speech Commands, SNIPS, LTS, L2ARCTIC, Speech Commands.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: Raw audio waveforms (mono, 16 kHz) and derived mel-spectrograms (used for TTS); pre-trained model checkpoints (Wav2Vec 2.0 XLSR-53) used in experiments.

**Annotation**: Transcripts for ASR; class labels for SER, SR, KS, IC; slot-type and slot-value annotations for Slot Filling (SLU); phoneme labels for Phoneme Recognition; speaker identifiers for TTS. (As described in the paper and Table 1.)

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics evaluation
- Subjective human evaluation (Mean Opinion Score)
- Model-based evaluation using pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 XLSR-53 with parameter-efficient adaptation modules
- Train/validation/test split with early stopping (5 epochs patience) and best-checkpoint test evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Weighted F1 Score
- Word Error Rate (WER)
- Phoneme Error Rate (PER)
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Slot-type F1 Score
- Mel-cepstrum Distortion (MCD)
- Mean Opinion Score (MOS)

**Calculation**: MCD computed using Equation 5 in the paper. WER computed using enterprise-grade Silero STT pre-trained models as stated. Accuracy reported as percent correct. PER and CER reported as percent error. Slot-type F1 and slot-value CER follow the SLU evaluation conventions referenced (see [25]).

**Interpretation**: Higher Accuracy, F1, and MOS indicate better performance; lower WER, PER, CER, and MCD indicate better performance. (Paper uses these directions when comparing methods.)

**Baseline Results**: Baseline results are reported in Tables 2-4 using Wav2Vec 2.0 (XLSR-53) fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods. Example: Fine-Tuning (Wav2Vec 2.0) SER (ESD) Accuracy 96.53%; ASR (LibriSpeech) WER 0.0903; KS (Speech Commands) Accuracy 99.08%. (See Tables 2-4 for full numerical results.)

**Validation**: Datasets partitioned into train/validation/test for each task. Early stopping applied: training stops when no improvement on validation set for five epochs; best checkpoint saved and evaluated on test set.
