# PixelProse

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: PixelProse

**Overview**: PixelProse is a comprehensive dataset of over 16M synthetically generated captions, leveraging vision-language models for detailed and accurate descriptions of images, addressing the weaknesses of existing alt-text datasets.

**Data Type**: image-caption pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google/cld3)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To serve as a high-quality dataset for training vision-language models by providing detailed image captions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Image Captioning
- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is sourced from three different web-scraped databases: CommonPool, CC12M, and RedCaps, comprising images and captions.

**Size**: 16,000,000 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated captions using vision-language models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
