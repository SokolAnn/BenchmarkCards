# CausalTalk

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: CausalTalk

**Overview**: CausalTalk is a multi-level dataset of Reddit posts from 2020 to 2024 discussing public health related to the COVID-19 pandemic, annotated across four causal tasks: binary causal classification, explicit vs. implicit causality, cause–effect span extraction, and causal gist generation.

**Data Type**: text

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive multi-level dataset for causal language analysis in informal social media discourse.

**Target Audience**:
- NLP Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Binary Causal Classification
- Explicit vs. Implicit Causality Detection
- Cause–Effect Span Extraction
- Causal Gist Generation

**Limitations**: Reddit’s user base is not demographically representative of the general population, potentially limiting the diversity of causal expressions.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Reddit posts discussing public health, specifically related to COVID-19.

**Size**: 10,120 annotated instances out of 239,222 submissions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Gold-standard labels by domain experts and silver-standard labels generated by GPT-4o, verified by human annotators.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Fine-tuning of transformer-based models
- Human evaluation of causal relations

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- ROUGE Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model predictions against gold-standard annotations.

**Interpretation**: Higher F1 Score indicates better model performance in detecting and generating causal language.

**Validation**: Validation is done through inter-annotator agreement on gold-standard annotations.
