## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation method for LVLMs by utilizing detailed image annotations and advanced LLMs as evaluators.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Image Captioning
- Visual Storytelling

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from open-world images and manually annotated with questions covering various dialogue abilities.

**Size**: 908 questions
