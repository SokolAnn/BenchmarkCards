# Distributive Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Alignment with Human Values

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: Distributive Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Alignment with Human Values

**Overview**: This paper examines the alignment of large language model (LLM) responses with fundamental fairness concepts such as equitability, envy-freeness, and Rawlsian maximin, providing a comparative benchmark of their ability to reflect these measures in resource allocation tasks.

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the alignment of large language models with human perceptions of fairness in resource allocation tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Ethicists
- Social Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Fairness Evaluation
- Resource Allocation

**Limitations**: The paper does not discuss specific limitations of the benchmark results.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Instances from the dataset developed by Herreiner and Puppe (2007).

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated using large language models reacting to predefined allocation tasks.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Fairness metrics based on equitability, envy-freeness, Rawlsian maximin

**Calculation**: Fairness and efficiency based on utility values assigned to different allocations by human and LLM responses.

**Interpretation**: Results indicating models' preferences regarding fairness principles are compared against human responses to gauge alignment.

**Validation**: Comparison of LLM outputs against human preferences across multiple allocation tasks.
