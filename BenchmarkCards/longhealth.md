# LongHealth

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LongHealth

**Overview**: The LongHealth benchmark is a collection of 20 fictional patient cases with detailed clinical narratives designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in medical question answering through 400 multiple-choice questions focused on information extraction, negation, and sorting.

**Data Type**: clinical case texts with question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MMLU

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a more realistic assessment of LLMs in a healthcare setting, especially in extracting information from lengthy clinical documents.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The benchmark's use of multiple-choice questions does not fully reflect real-world clinical situations, which typically involve open-ended queries.
