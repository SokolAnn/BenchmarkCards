# FINTAGGING

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FINTAGGING

**Overview**: FINTAGGING is the first full-scope, table-aware XBRL benchmark designed to evaluate the structured information extraction and semantic alignment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of XBRL-based financial reporting.

**Data Type**: table-aware information extraction

**Domains**:
- Finance

**Languages**:
- English

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate LLMs on their ability to perform full-scope XBRL tagging, including fact extraction and concept alignment.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Financial Analysts

**Tasks**:
- Structured Information Extraction
- Concept Linking

**Limitations**: The benchmark focuses primarily on US-GAAP financial reports and does not cover all global accounting standards.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected annual 10-K reports from publicly listed companies filed with the SEC.

**Size**: 81,325 facts

**Format**: Tabular and textual

**Annotation**: Gold-standard annotations of numerical entity types and associated US-GAAP concepts.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Zero-shot evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Macro F1 Score
- Micro F1 Score
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Computed using pair-level metrics for FinNI and accuracy for FinCL.

**Interpretation**: Performance threshold varies based on specific subtask; higher scores indicate better extraction and alignment.

**Baseline Results**: Preliminary evaluation results show significant variance in performance across different models.

**Validation**: Joint evaluation framework for structured triplet {Fact, Type, Tag} assessment.
