**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 1013 exemplary environments across 9 unique tasks designed for multi-turn interaction.

**Size**: 1013 environments

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually annotated subgoals verified through multiple stages by human annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology
