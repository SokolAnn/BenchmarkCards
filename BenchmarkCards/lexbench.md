## üíæ Data

**Source**: Multiple datasets curated from existing sources, including ID10M and PIE datasets.

**Size**: 10 datasets across various tasks

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated and curated for specific semantic tasks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Exact Match (EM)
- Token-level F1 Score
