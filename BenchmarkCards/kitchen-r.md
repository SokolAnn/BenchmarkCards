**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A digital twin simulated kitchen environment generated using Isaac Sim.

**Size**: 2700 mobile manipulation trajectories, 563 language instructions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated from templates based on kitchen scenes.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Exact Match (EM)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Success Rate (SR)

**Calculation**: EM is calculated as the average of correctly predicted steps of plans, MSE is the average distance between predicted and expert trajectories.

**Interpretation**: A high EM score indicates good performance in planning, while low MSE reflects high accuracy in trajectory prediction.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The benchmark was validated through data collection and evaluation during the Embodied AI track of the AIJ Contest.
