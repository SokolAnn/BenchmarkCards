## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VIDHALLUC

**Overview**: VIDHALLUC is the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for video understanding, assessing hallucinations across three dimensions: action, temporal sequence, and scene transition using 5,002 videos and 9,295 QA pairs.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models during video understanding tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Action Recognition
- Temporal Reasoning
- Scene Transition Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Automated data collection pipeline utilizing existing video description datasets, including ActivityNet, YouCook2, and VALOR32K.

**Size**: 5,002 videos and 9,295 QA pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated questions verified by human annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated as the number of correctly answered questions divided by the total number of questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in identifying actions, sequences, and scene transitions.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Extensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across key dimensions.
