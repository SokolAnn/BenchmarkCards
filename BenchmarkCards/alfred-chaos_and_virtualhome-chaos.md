# ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS

**Overview**: The paper introduces LERa, a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach, and presents two new evaluation datasets, ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS, to assess the ability of the approach to replan in dynamic environments.

**Data Type**: episodes

**Domains**:
- Robotics

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://lera-robo.github.io)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a replanning methodology for robots using visual feedback and to evaluate its effectiveness through newly introduced datasets.

**Target Audience**:
- Robotic Researchers
- AI Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Replanning
- Task Execution

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The datasets are created based on existing environments corresponding to tasks in ALFRED and VirtualHome.

**Size**: 500 episodes for each dataset

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Agent-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Success Rate (SR)
- Goal-Condition Success (GCR)
- Success Rate of Replanning (SRep)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the completion of tasks and comparisons against predefined success criteria.

**Interpretation**: Higher metrics indicate better performance of the replanning approach in dynamic environments.

**Baseline Results**: LERa improved success rates significantly, achieving over 40% improvement over baselines.

**Validation**: Experiments including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot confirmed the effectiveness of LERa.
