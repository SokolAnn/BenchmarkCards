# ShIOEnv (Shell Input-Output Environment)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ShIOEnv (Shell Input-Output Environment)

**Overview**: ShIOEnv is a Linux shell input-output environment that allows for the efficient exploration and evaluation of command sequences, focusing on argument-level redundancy and execution feedback to improve the sample efficiency of command synthesis.

**Data Type**: shell input-output behavior pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- NL2Bash
- NL2CMD

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of ShIOEnv is to provide a flexible environment for generating and evaluating shell command sequences for better command synthesis and behavioral modeling.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Command Synthesis

**Limitations**: Excludes interactive commands and faces challenges regarding automation; redundancy analysis is computationally intensive.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated from interactions with the ShIOEnv environment.

**Size**: 71,794 samples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Behavioral logging during command execution.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Proximal Policy Optimization

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score
- chrF Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the output of the generated commands compared to expected outputs for evaluating command behavior.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores on BLEU and chrF indicate better performance in command synthesis.

**Baseline Results**: CodeT5 fine-tuned on ShIOEnv datasets achieved a BLEU4 score of up to 0.618.

**Validation**: Dataset is validated via execution feedback and performance metrics from downstream modeling.
