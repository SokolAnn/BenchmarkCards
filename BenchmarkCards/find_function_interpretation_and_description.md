# FIND (Function INterpretation and Description)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FIND (Function INterpretation and Description)

**Overview**: FIND is a benchmark suite for evaluating the building blocks of automated interpretability methods on functions whose structure is known a priori. It contains procedurally generated function interpretation problems and accompanies descriptions of the kind intended to be generated by interpreters.

**Data Type**: function interpretation problems

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/multimodal-interpretability/FIND)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate methods that use pretrained language models to produce code-based and natural language descriptions of function behavior and assess the efficacy of automated interpretability tools.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Interpretability Tool Developers

**Tasks**:
- Function Interpretation
- Automated Interpretability

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Procedurally generated functions with accompanying descriptions

**Size**: 2,000 function interpretation problems (1,000 numeric and 1,000 string functions)

**Format**: Python scripts

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Unit testing
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE)
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated by comparing outputs of the interpreter's code to ground-truth implementations of functions.

**Interpretation**: Higher NMSE indicates poorer approximation to ground-truth function behavior.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluations against ground-truth descriptions were performed using a structured evaluation protocol.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Fairness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: N/A
