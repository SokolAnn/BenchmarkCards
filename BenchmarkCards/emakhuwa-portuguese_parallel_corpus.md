# Emakhuwa-Portuguese Parallel Corpus

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Emakhuwa-Portuguese Parallel Corpus

**Overview**: This paper describes the creation of the Emakhuwa-Portuguese parallel corpus, which is a collection of texts for machine translation between the Emakhuwa language and Portuguese, aimed at improving resources for low-resource languages.

**Data Type**: parallel sentence pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Portuguese
- Emakhuwa

**Similar Benchmarks**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a parallel corpus for Emakhuwa and Portuguese to support machine translation.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- NLP Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Machine Translation

**Limitations**: Further processing and normalization of texts are required.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from the Jehovah‚Äôs Witness website, African Story Book, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Mozambican legal documents.

**Size**: 47,415 sentence pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual alignment of Portuguese and Emakhuwa sentences

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Neural machine translation model training
- Manual data alignment

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score

**Calculation**: BLEU score calculations based on parallel sentence pairs.

**Interpretation**: Higher BLEU scores indicate better performance of translation models.

**Baseline Results**: Initial NMT model trained with default OpenNMT configuration shows BLEU scores for translations.

**Validation**: Data splits were assigned for training and test sets at a ratio of 9:1.
