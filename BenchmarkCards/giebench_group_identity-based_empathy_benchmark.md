# GIEBench (Group Identity-based Empathy Benchmark)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: GIEBench (Group Identity-based Empathy Benchmark)

**Overview**: GIEBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the empathy of large language models (LLMs) towards diverse group identities. It includes 11 identity dimensions covering 97 group identities with 999 single-choice questions related to specific group identities.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the empathetic capabilities of large language models concerning diverse group identities.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Empathy Evaluation

**Limitations**: As a pioneering dataset, GIEBench has limitations in covering all potential contentious scenarios of human identity.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Generated using internet sources, GPT-4, and human annotation for controversial topics.

**Size**: 999 entries

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by five independent annotators with procedures to ensure quality.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Prompt-based Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy calculated based on model responses aligned with user identities.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better empathetic understanding of varied identities.

**Validation**: The performance of models is validated based on their ability to respond appropriately to prompted identities.

## ⚠️ Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Fairness
- Safety

**Atlas Risks**:
No specific atlas risks defined

**Demographic Analysis**: Consideration of diverse identities, though limited to 11 dimensions.

**Potential Harm**: Potential misalignment of empathy exhibited by LLMs across different group identities.
