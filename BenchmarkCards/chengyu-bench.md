# CHENGYU-BENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CHENGYU-BENCH

**Overview**: CHENGYU-BENCH is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models on their understanding and usage of Chinese idioms across three tasks: Evaluative Connotation, Appropriateness, and Open Cloze.

**Data Type**: human-verified examples

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Chinese

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sofyc/ChengyuBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a rigorous testing ground for evaluating culturally-specific language understanding in large language models focused on Chinese idioms.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Evaluative Connotation
- Appropriateness
- Open Cloze

**Limitations**: The benchmark focuses exclusively on canonical four-character chengyu and employs a binary polarity scheme.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Diverse high-quality texts from webpages, news articles, academic papers, and essays containing Chinese idioms.

**Size**: 2,937 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human-verified annotations for each task.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Model evaluation
- Error analysis

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Performance is measured based on the models' correct classifications and predictions on the benchmark tasks.

**Interpretation**: High accuracy indicates effective understanding and use of Chinese idioms; lower scores highlight challenges in contextual application.

**Validation**: Evaluation of several leading large language models.
