# Anchor Points: Benchmarking Models with Much Fewer Examples

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Anchor Points: Benchmarking Models with Much Fewer Examples

**Overview**: Anchor Point Selection is a technique that finds small evaluation sets maximally representative of model behavior over large datasets, enabling efficient model ranking and prediction estimation.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08638)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a method for benchmarking language models with significantly fewer evaluation examples while maintaining reliable assessment.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: Anchor points may underperform random selection on large evaluation sets and do not guarantee generalization across all models.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Anchor points selected from larger datasets like GLUE and MMLU.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by selecting instances that capture model behavior.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Anchor Point Predictor
- Anchor Point Weighted Score

**Metrics**:
- Kendall's œÑ
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Calculation**: Anchor point predictions correlate model performance with reduced evaluation sizes using instance-level predictions from source models.

**Interpretation**: Higher correlation scores indicate better representation of model performance across datasets.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Evaluated across multiple GLUE datasets and performance metrics.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Fairness

**Atlas Risks**:
No specific atlas risks defined

**Demographic Analysis**: The method may overlook minority subsets of data distributions, affecting generalization.

**Potential Harm**: Potential harm by excluding certain data points, impacting performance in edge cases.
