## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs in solving long-step geometry problems requiring auxiliary lines.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Educational Institutions

**Tasks**:
- Geometry Problem Solving

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from Zhongkao mathematics papers across 34 provincial-level regions in China

**Size**: 2,186 problems

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually curated solutions and reasoning steps with auxiliary line constructions

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Answer Correctness Score (ACS)
- Process Correctness Score (PCS)
- Process Quality Score (PQS)

**Calculation**: ACS evaluates final answer accuracy, PCS checks correctness of the entire solution process including errors, and PQS assesses the quality of reasoning steps evaluated via a weighted scoring system.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance in answering and reasoning accuracy of MLLMs on complex geometry problems.

**Baseline Results**: Performance results of 13 leading MLLMs were evaluated, with distinct findings based on step lengths and problem types.

**Validation**: The benchmark's effectiveness was validated through extensive testing across various MLLMs.
