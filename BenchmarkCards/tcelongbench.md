# TCELongBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TCELongBench

**Overview**: TCELongBench is established to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text through three distinct tasks - reading comprehension, temporal sequencing, and future event forecasting.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02472)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of TCELongBench is to evaluate LLMs' capability of temporal and long text understanding.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Reading Comprehension
- Temporal Sequencing
- Future Event Forecasting

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Mideast-TE corpus that has identified Temporal Complex Events from GDELT.

**Size**: 88,821 question answering pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated using a generate-then-verify paradigm.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
