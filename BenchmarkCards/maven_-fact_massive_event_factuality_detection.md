# MAVEN -FACT (Massive Event Factuality Detection)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MAVEN -FACT (Massive Event Factuality Detection)

**Overview**: MAVEN -FACT is a large-scale event factuality detection dataset containing factuality annotations for 112,276 events. It aims to provide high-quality data for assessing the factuality of textual events and incorporates supporting evidence for improved interpretability.

**Data Type**: event factuality annotations

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/THU-KEG/MAVEN-FACT)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To facilitate research in event factuality detection and improve the understanding of event knowledge.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Event Factuality Detection
- Supporting Evidence Prediction

**Limitations**: Language coverage is limited to English, and the annotation approach may introduce noise, although mitigation strategies are in place.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: MAVEN dataset

**Size**: 112,276 events

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated by a combination of LLM pre-annotation followed by human verification, ensuring high quality.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Macro F1 Score

**Calculation**: F1 Score calculated based on precision and recall across multiple factuality categories.

**Interpretation**: Higher F1 scores indicate better performance in distinguishing event factuality.

**Baseline Results**: Best-performing model achieves a 47.6% macro F1 score.

**Validation**: High inter-annotator agreement reported at 96.1%.
