## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate and rank the performance of large language models in environmental science.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: The evaluation method is susceptible to test data leakage due to reliance on existing large language models for question generation.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Questions derived from the curricula of top international universities.

**Size**: 936 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually refined and proofread by researchers.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- 0-shot testing
- 5-shot testing
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: The total score is calculated as the arithmetic mean of model scores, adjusted by the coefficient of variation.

**Interpretation**: A score above 60 is considered passing; models are evaluated based on their ability to answer questions correctly.

**Baseline Results**: In the 5-shot tests, 61.3% of models passed; 48.39% passed the 0-shot tests.

**Validation**: Evaluated against 31 open-source large language models, providing comparative results.
