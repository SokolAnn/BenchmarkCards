# HATEBENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: HATEBENCH

**Overview**: HATEBENCH is a framework for benchmarking hate speech detectors on LLM-generated content, consisting of a dataset generated by six large language models covering 34 identity groups and meticulously annotated.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/HateBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To assess the effectiveness of hate speech detectors against LLM-generated content and reveal the robustness of these detectors in counteracting LLM-driven hate campaigns.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Practitioners
- Platform Moderators

**Tasks**:
- Hate Speech Detection

**Limitations**: Detectors demonstrate weak robustness against evolving LLMs and adversarial attacks.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: HATEBENCH SET, generated by six LLMs and manually annotated.

**Size**: 7,838 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manually annotated by three labelers with an inter-agreement of Krippendorff's Alpha = 0.846.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated using standard classification evaluation metrics.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance of hate speech detectors.

**Baseline Results**: Perspective F1-score: 0.878 on GPT-3.5; drops to 0.621 on GPT-4.

**Validation**: Results are based on assessing eight representative hate speech detectors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Safety

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Robustness**: Prompt injection attack

**Demographic Analysis**: Analysis was conducted on different identity groups within the dataset.

**Potential Harm**: ['Potential psychological and emotional harm due to automated hate speech generation.']
