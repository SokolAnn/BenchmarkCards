## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the consistency of large language models' responses across multiple languages.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Open-ended Generation
- Information Consistency
- Empathy Consistency

**Limitations**: The framework relies on high-quality translation systems for evaluating low-resource languages.

## üíæ Data
