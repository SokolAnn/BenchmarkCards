**Name**: Graphine: A Dataset for Graph-aware Terminology Definition Generation

**Overview**: Graphine encompasses 2,010,648 terminology definition pairs organized in 227 directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which makes it a unique resource for exploring graph-aware text generation.

**Data Type**: terminology definition pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Biomedical

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://zenodo.org/record/5320310#.YSxHgI77Q2w)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective is to study definition generation in the biomedical domain.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation
- Definition Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from three major biomedical ontology databases: Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBO), BioPortal, and EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service (OLS).

**Size**: 2,010,648 pairs
