# LingBench++ (Linguistically-Informed Benchmark and Reasoning Framework for Multi-Step and Cross-Cultural Inference)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LingBench++ (Linguistically-Informed Benchmark and Reasoning Framework for Multi-Step and Cross-Cultural Inference)

**Overview**: LingBench++ is a linguistically-informed benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complex linguistic tasks inspired by the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL), providing structured reasoning traces and typological metadata across low-resource and cross-cultural languages.

**Data Type**: linguistic problems with structured reasoning

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Arabic
- Chinese
- Hindi
- Spanish

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- LingOly
- IOLBENCH
- Linguini

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/username/repo)
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a peer-reviewed benchmark for evaluating and improving language models‚Äô linguistic reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving problems that require cross-cultural understanding.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Linguists
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Linguistic Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 96 problems sourced from the IOL archive (2003‚Äì2024) with expert-verified reasoning traces.

**Size**: 96 problems (225 sub-problems)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Expert-verified reasoning traces combined with rich typological metadata.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on both final outputs and structured reasoning processes.

**Interpretation**: High scores indicate better reasoning and understanding of linguistic structures.

**Baseline Results**: Models are evaluated against established benchmarks like LingOly and IOLBENCH.

**Validation**: Benchmark is validated through expert evaluations and systematic comparisons.
