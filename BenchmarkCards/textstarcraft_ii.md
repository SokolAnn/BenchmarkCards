# TextStarCraft II

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TextStarCraft II

**Overview**: TextStarCraft II is a specialized environment for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-time strategic scenarios within StarCraft II, directly addressing the lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in real-time decision-making and long-term planning.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Gaming

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the real-time strategy decision-making capabilities of Large Language Models in the context of StarCraft II.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Gaming AI Developers
- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Real-time Strategy Evaluation
- Decision Making

**Limitations**: The reliance on non-visual data inputs and the use of scripted micro policies could restrict the diversity of AI strategies available.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: TextStarCraft II framework using the python-sc2 interface.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Win Rate
- Population Block Ratio (PBR)
- Resource Utilization Ratio (RUR)
- Average Population Utilization (APU)
- Technology Rate (TR)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on game performance, comparing agent effectiveness against built-in StarCraft II AI.

**Interpretation**: Higher win rates and better resource utilization indicate effective strategy execution by LLMs.

**Validation**: Validation procedures include testing against built-in AI at varying difficulty levels.
