# AGENTS NET

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AGENTS NET

**Overview**: AGENTS NET is a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning that measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a network topology. It evaluates multi-agent systems on fundamental distributed computing problems such as leader election, consensus, maximal matching, and others.
