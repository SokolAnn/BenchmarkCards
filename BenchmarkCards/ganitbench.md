## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- Two-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated as number of correct answers divided by the total number of questions.

**Interpretation**: An accuracy of 40% indicates a reasonable performance for the model on challenging mathematical questions.

**Validation**: Evaluated the performance of models under normal conditions and with a 'Double Lock' constraint.
