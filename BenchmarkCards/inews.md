## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enable research in LLM personalization, subjectivity, affective computing, and human behavior simulation by modeling individual-level affective responses to news content.

**Target Audience**:
- Affective Computing Researchers
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Social Computing Scholars

**Tasks**:
- Emotion Detection
- News Sentiment Analysis

**Limitations**: While providing substantial demographic and geographic diversity, the dataset is focused on UK-based annotators and news outlets, which may limit generalizability to other populations.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Annotations collected from 291 demographically diverse UK participants for 2,899 Facebook news posts.

**Size**: 2,899 posts

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Annotations include valence-arousal-dominance ratings, discrete emotion classifications, and modality influence assessments.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Quantitative analysis

**Metrics**:
- Valence
- Arousal
- Dominance
- Exact Accuracy
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on annotator responses to news post annotations and were validated against established psychometric standards.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores in valence indicate more positive emotional responses, while higher arousal reflects greater emotional engagement.

**Validation**: Inter-annotator agreement was assessed using Krippendorff‚Äôs alpha.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Privacy**: Personal information in data

**Demographic Analysis**: The dataset features a diverse group of annotators across various demographics.

**Potential Harm**: Risk of generating biased models based on subjective annotations and potential privacy concerns related to persona data.

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: No personally identifiable information was collected. All participants provided informed consent.

**Data Licensing**: Not Applicable

**Consent Procedures**: Informed consent was obtained from all annotators before participation.

**Compliance With Regulations**: The study was conducted with the approval of the institutional ethics review board.
