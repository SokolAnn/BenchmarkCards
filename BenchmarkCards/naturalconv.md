## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the ability of generating topic-driven, natural multi-turn conversations and to facilitate further research in dialogue systems.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Dialogue Generation
- Conversational AI

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Collected from news articles and generated by annotators simulating conversations.

**Size**: 400,000 utterances; 19,900 dialogues

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: Manually annotated dialogue by multiple participants.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Retrieval-based models
- Generation-based models

**Metrics**:
- BLEU-1
- BLEU-2
- F1 Score
- BERTScore

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the similarity between generated responses and reference dialogues.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores in BLEU and F1 reflect better alignment with human responses, while lower scores indicate more variability.

**Baseline Results**: Manual evaluation scores indicate a naturalness score of 2.8 on a scale of 1 to 3.

**Validation**: Manual validation of dialogue naturalness was performed.
