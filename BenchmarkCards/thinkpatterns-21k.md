# ThinkPatterns-21k

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: ThinkPatterns-21k

**Overview**: ThinkPatterns-21k is a curated dataset comprising 21,000 instruction-response pairs collected from existing instruction-following datasets augmented with five distinct internal thinking patterns: unstructured thinking (monologue) and four structured variants (decomposition, self-ask, self-debate, and self-critic) for comprehensive evaluation of thinking patterns in large language models (LLMs).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To facilitate research on the impact of various thinking types on model performance, particularly in large language models, by providing a dataset that combines instruction-response pairs with structured thinking patterns.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Collected from existing instruction-following datasets, specifically the Infinite Instruct dataset.

**Size**: 21,000 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated by a large language model (GPT-4o) with specific prompts to create internal thinking patterns.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Win Rate (WR)
- Length-Controlled Win Rate (LC)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on comparative evaluation of model-generated responses against baseline responses.

**Interpretation**: Higher WR indicates better performance in preference over baseline responses; LC normalizes for response length to mitigate bias.

**Baseline Results**: Compared against performance of baseline models on AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

**Validation**: Evaluated across various model sizes (3B-32B parameters) through extensive experimentation.
