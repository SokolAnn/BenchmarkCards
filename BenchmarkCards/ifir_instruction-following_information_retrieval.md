## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate instruction-following capabilities of information retrievers across specialized domains and provide insights for model development.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts
- Information Retrieval Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Information Retrieval
- Instruction Following

**Limitations**: The dataset has a limited number of queries accompanied by instructions and does not provide a training dataset for future works.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Adapted from established traditional information retrieval benchmarks in expert domains (Finance, Law, Healthcare, Scientific Literature).

**Size**: 2,426 queries

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human-validated instruction-following queries.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- LLM-based evaluation metrics

**Metrics**:
- nDCG
- INSTFOL

**Calculation**: Both metrics evaluate the performance of the instruction-following retrieval systems, with INSTFOL specifically assessing the improvement gained by incorporating instructions.

**Interpretation**: Higher nDCG and INSTFOL scores indicate better instruction-following capabilities and effective retrieval.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline performance was assessed against traditional retrieval models and instruction-tuned models.

**Validation**: Extensive human expert validation during dataset construction.
