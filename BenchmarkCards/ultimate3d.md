# Ultimate3D

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Ultimate3D

**Overview**: Ultimate3D is a dataset focused on capturing camera-object relations by generating photo-realistic images from 3D assets and corresponding text instructions, aiming to improve the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual questions regarding these relations.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08513)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that facilitates the training and evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding camera-object relations.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Image Captioning

**Limitations**: The numerical prediction of camera-object relations can be challenging for MLLMs compared to the categorical prediction.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is generated from open-sourced 3D assets using rendering techniques to produce diverse camera-object relation images.

**Size**: 240,000 question-answering pairs and 8,000 benchmark images.

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated with precise camera-object relation information and corresponding textual descriptions generated by large language models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Image Generation
- Question Answering

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: The accuracy is calculated as the percentage of correct responses provided by MLLMs when evaluated against the benchmark.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in understanding camera-object relations.

**Baseline Results**: Fine-tuned models show an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% when evaluated using the Ultimate3D benchmark.

**Validation**: The benchmark was validated by comparing fine-tuned MLLMs' performance against commercial models.
