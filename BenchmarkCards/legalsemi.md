# LegalSemi

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LegalSemi

**Overview**: LegalSemi is a benchmark specifically curated for legal scenario analysis, comprising 54 legal scenarios annotated by legal experts based on the IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) framework from Malaysian Contract Law. It aims to address limitations in existing datasets by providing a structured knowledge base (SKE) for enhancing legal reasoning tasks.
