# LLMediator (GPT-4 assisted online dispute resolution)

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLMediator (GPT-4 assisted online dispute resolution)

**Overview**: This paper presents an evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in the context of dispute resolution, utilizing a novel dataset of 50 dispute scenarios to compare the performance of LLMs with human annotators across several key metrics.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Legal

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To investigate the performance of large language models in selecting intervention types and generating intervention messages for dispute resolution tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Legal Practitioners
- AI Ethics Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Text Generation
- Dispute Resolution

**Limitations**: The evaluation was conducted with human annotators who lacked formal mediation training, which may have skewed results.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Manually created dataset of 50 dispute scenarios.

**Size**: 50 scenarios

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotations by authors with varying legal knowledge.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Blind evaluation
- Comparative analysis

**Metrics**:
- Overall preference
- Understanding and contextualization
- Neutrality and impartiality
- Empathy awareness
- Resolution quality

**Calculation**: Evaluation scores were calculated using a 5-point Likert scale based on preferences of evaluators.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better alignment with mediation principles and effectiveness of intervention messages.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The results of LLMs were compared against human performance. Evaluators rated LLM messages as superior in many cases.
