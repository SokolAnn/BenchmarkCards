# SPECBENCH (Specification Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SPECBENCH (Specification Benchmark)

**Overview**: SPECBENCH is a unified benchmark for measuring specification alignment of large language models (LLMs), covering 5 scenarios, 103 specifications, and 1,500 prompts, designed to assess behavioral and safety compliance.

**Data Type**: prompt-response pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- SALAD-Bench
- AIR-Bench

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/username/repo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of SPECBENCH is to evaluate LLMs on their ability to comply with dynamic, scenario-specific safety and behavioral specifications.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Specification Alignment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Data comprises synthetic prompts and existing resources used to measure alignment with scenario-specific specifications.

**Size**: 1,500 prompts

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Prompts assessed based on compliance with specified safety and behavioral requirements.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- LLM evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Specification Alignment Rate (SAR)

**Calculation**: SAR is calculated by averaging the scores over all prompts based on compliance with specifications.

**Interpretation**: Higher SAR indicates better alignment with the specified behavioral and safety requirements.

**Validation**: Evaluated across multiple models with both closed-source and open-source families.
