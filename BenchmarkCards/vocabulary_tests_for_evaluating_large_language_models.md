# Vocabulary Tests for Evaluating Large Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Vocabulary Tests for Evaluating Large Language Models

**Overview**: This paper advocates the revival of vocabulary tests as a valuable tool for assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) and evaluates their lexical knowledge using various vocabulary test formats across English and Spanish.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions, yes/no questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Spanish

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the performance of large language models on vocabulary tests and to propose vocabulary tests as a complementary approach for assessing LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Cognitive Scientists
- Psycholinguists

**Tasks**:
- Vocabulary Assessment

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various vocabulary tests adapted for LLM evaluation.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated evaluation using APIs of LLMs

**Metrics**:
- Percentage of correct responses

**Calculation**: Performance metrics are computed based on the proportion of correct answers given by the LLMs.

**Interpretation**: Higher percentages indicate better linguistic knowledge of the model, while errors highlight gaps in understanding.

**Baseline Results**: Performance on tests varied across models, with the best results seen for the largest models.

**Validation**: Results are evaluated by comparing them to human performance and existing vocabulary benchmarks.
