# IrokoBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: IrokoBench

**Overview**: IrokoBench is a human-translated benchmark dataset for 17 typologically-diverse low-resource African languages covering three tasks: natural language inference (AfriXNLI), mathematical reasoning (AfriMGSM), and multi-choice knowledge-based question answering (AfriMMLU).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- French
- Amharic
- Ewe
- Hausa
- Igbo
- Kinyarwanda
- Luganda
- Oromo
- Swahili
- Twi
- Wolof

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a robust evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) on African languages across complex tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Natural Language Inference
- Mathematical Reasoning
- Multi-choice Question Answering

**Limitations**: The benchmark is human-translated which may include translationese effects, and it does not cover all African language families.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Human translations from English datasets (XNLI, MGSM, MMLU).
