# AssoCiAm

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: AssoCiAm

**Overview**: AssoCiAm is a benchmark designed to evaluate associative ability in multimodal large language models while circumventing ambiguity through a hybrid computational method.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of AssoCiAm is to provide a more accurate and reliable evaluation of associative abilities in multimodal language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Associative Question Answering

**Limitations**: While focusing on associations based on object shapes, further work is needed to address the diversity of answers.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: The dataset consists of images and associated question-options pairs created by a hybrid computational method.

**Size**: 2,025 test samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Images are filtered and generated based on representative masks to ensure quality.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
