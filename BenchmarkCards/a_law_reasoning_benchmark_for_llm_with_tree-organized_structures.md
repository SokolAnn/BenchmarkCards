# A Law Reasoning Benchmark for LLM with Tree-Organized Structures

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: A Law Reasoning Benchmark for LLM with Tree-Organized Structures

**Overview**: We propose a transparent law reasoning schema enriched with hierarchical factum probandum, evidence, and implicit experiences, along with a challenging task to create a hierarchical reasoning structure from a textual case description. We introduce the first crowd-sourced dataset for this task, enabling comprehensive evaluation.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Law

**Languages**:
- Chinese
