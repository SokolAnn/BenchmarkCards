# Text-to-SQL Empowered by Large Language Models: A Benchmark Evaluation

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Text-to-SQL Empowered by Large Language Models: A Benchmark Evaluation

**Overview**: The paper presents a systematic benchmark for LLM-based Text-to-SQL, addressing the absence of a systematic evaluation framework. It proposes a new integrated solution, DAIL-SQL, which achieves a performance of 86.6% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard, surpassing previous methodologies.

**Data Type**: question-SQL pairs

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Execution Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the output correctness of SQL queries compared to ground truth queries.

**Interpretation**: Higher execution accuracy indicates better performance in translating natural language questions to SQL queries.

**Baseline Results**: Previous state-of-the-art methods include DIN-SQL with 85.3% execution accuracy.

**Validation**: Empirical evaluation against existing state benchmarks.
