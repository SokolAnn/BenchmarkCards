## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To facilitate empirical studies of automated program repair (APR) techniques on regression bugs and provide a high-quality benchmark for future research.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Practitioners
- Software Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Automated Program Repair

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 99 regression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub repositories.

**Size**: 99 regression bugs

**Format**: Structured database

**Annotation**: Automated validation with filtering criteria to identify true regression bugs.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Precision

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the number of plausible patches and correct patches generated by APR techniques.

**Interpretation**: A higher number of correct patches indicates better performance of the automated program repair tools.

**Validation**: Each regression bug is validated through automated checks based on behavioral conditions.
