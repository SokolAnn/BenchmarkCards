# CoSpace (Continuous Space Perception Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CoSpace (Continuous Space Perception Benchmark)

**Overview**: CoSpace is a multi-image visual understanding benchmark designed to assess the Continuous Space perception ability for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), comprising 2,918 images and 1,626 question-answer pairs across seven tasks to evaluate spatial reasoning and multi-image perception.

**Data Type**: image-question-answer pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/CoSpace)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the continuous space perception ability of vision-language models through multi-image understanding tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Directional Recognition
- Directional Object Perception
- Counting
- Rotation-Angle
- Rotation-Difference
- Planning-Question Answering
- Planning-Decision

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Images collected from Baidu Map Panorama API and the HM3D dataset.

**Size**: 2,918 images, 1,626 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated by GPT-4o and verified by human annotators.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Query-wise accuracy (ACCq)
- Pair-wise accuracy (ACCp)

**Calculation**: Evaluation metrics are calculated based on the correctness of answers provided by models compared to ground truths.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in understanding continuous visual space.

**Baseline Results**: Average human performance across tasks was significantly higher than the best model scores.

**Validation**: Validated through manual review and comparisons with human annotators.
