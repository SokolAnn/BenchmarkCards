# CR-LT-KGQA (Commonsense Reasoning and Long-Tail Knowledge Question Answering)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: CR-LT-KGQA (Commonsense Reasoning and Long-Tail Knowledge Question Answering)

**Overview**: CR-LT-KGQA is a novel Knowledge Graph Question Answering dataset that requires commonsense reasoning and focuses on long-tail entities, posing significant challenges for hallucination-prone large language models.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/D3Mlab/cr-lt-kgqa)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a challenging KGQA dataset that requires commonsense reasoning and targets long-tail knowledge.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering
- Claim Verification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Wikidata

**Size**: 350 queries
