**Goal**: To evaluate the complex mathematical reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models in error detection settings.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Error Step Identification
- Error Categorization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is sourced from a global educational organization's question bank, specifically designed for K-12 mathematics.

**Size**: 2,500 multimodal questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by educational experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics for both identifying the first erroneous step and categorizing the error.

**Interpretation**: Accuracy indicates the model's ability to correctly identify error steps and categorize them based on predefined error types.

**Baseline Results**: Human evaluation accuracy is significantly higher than MLLMs, with 69.8% for step identification and 60.7% for categorization.

**Validation**: Extensive experiments were conducted to benchmark MLLMs against educational expert evaluators.
