# PersoBench (Personalized Response Generation Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: PersoBench (Personalized Response Generation Benchmark)

**Overview**: PersoBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization ability of large language models (LLMs) in persona-aware dialogue generation within a zero-shot setting. It benchmarks LLMs across three well-known persona-aware datasets and evaluates multiple dimensions of response quality including fluency, diversity, coherence, and personalization.
