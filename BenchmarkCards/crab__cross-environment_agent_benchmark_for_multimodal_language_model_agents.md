**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: CRAB Benchmark-v0 dataset comprising 120 tasks across Android and Ubuntu environments.

**Size**: 120 tasks

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated task generation and evaluation methodologies.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Graph-based evaluation
