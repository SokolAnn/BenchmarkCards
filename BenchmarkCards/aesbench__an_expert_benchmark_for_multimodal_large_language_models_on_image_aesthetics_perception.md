# AesBench: An Expert Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models on Image Aesthetics Perception

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AesBench: An Expert Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models on Image Aesthetics Perception

**Overview**: AesBench is an expert benchmark designed to evaluate the aesthetic perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through the Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD) and a set of integrative criteria focused on four dimensions: Aesthetic Perception (AesP), Empathy (AesE), Assessment (AesA), and Interpretation (AesI).

**Data Type**: image-caption pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Aesthetic Perception
- Aesthetic Empathy
- Aesthetic Assessment
- Aesthetic Interpretation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD) constructed from diverse image datasets including natural, artistic, and AI-generated images annotated by aesthetic experts.

**Size**: 2,800 images, 8,400 question-answer pairs, and 2,800 aesthetic interpretations

**Format**: N/A
