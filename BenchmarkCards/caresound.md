**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset is built from diverse open-source medical audio recordings, including ICBHI, KAUH, CirCor, SPRSound, and ZCHSound.

**Size**: 16,273 audio samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Generated QA pairs based on metadata and annotations via large language models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Open-ended Question Answering
- Closed-ended Classification

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- BERTScore
- METEOR

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model predictions against ground truth using semantic and lexical similarity metrics.

**Interpretation**: Higher BERTScore and METEOR values indicate better performance in generating semantically and contextually relevant outputs.

**Baseline Results**: CaReAQA achieves 86.2% accuracy on open-ended diagnostic reasoning tasks.

**Validation**: The benchmark is validated via rigorous testing on multiple unseen datasets.
