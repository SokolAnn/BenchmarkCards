# EEE-Bench (Electrical and Electronics Engineering Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: EEE-Bench (Electrical and Electronics Engineering Benchmark)

**Overview**: EEE-Bench is a pioneering multimodal benchmark designed for assessing the reasoning abilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) problems. It consists of 2860 samples spanning 10 essential subjects, featuring a diverse range of visual contexts such as electric and digital circuits, system diagrams, and more.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice and free-form questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01492)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users
