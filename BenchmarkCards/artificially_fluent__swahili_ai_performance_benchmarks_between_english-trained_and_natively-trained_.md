# Artificially Fluent: Swahili AI Performance Benchmarks Between English-Trained and Natively-Trained Datasets

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Artificially Fluent: Swahili AI Performance Benchmarks Between English-Trained and Natively-Trained Datasets

**Overview**: This study compares the performance of monolingual Swahili and English-trained BERT models to evaluate language consistency versus cross-lingual abstraction in AI models. It highlights the importance of training and testing models in their native languages.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Swahili
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: Highlight the importance of language equity in AI by comparing monolingual and multilingual models in performance benchmarks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Educators
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Swahili news articles and their categories sourced from the 'Knowledge For All' foundation and an English equivalent dataset from the BBC.

**Size**: N/A
