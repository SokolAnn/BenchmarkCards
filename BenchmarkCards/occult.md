# OCCULT

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OCCULT

**Overview**: OCCULT introduces a methodology and evaluation framework for assessing large language models (LLMs) for offensive cyber operations (OCO). It includes three benchmarks: the Threat Actor Competency Test for LLMs (TACTL), the BloodHound Equivalency Test, and CyberLayer simulations, aimed at evaluating OCO capabilities.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions

**Domains**:
- Cybersecurity

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CyberSecEval 3
- PentestGPT
- Cybench

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15797)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a standardized framework for evaluating the risks associated with large language models in offensive cyber operations.

**Target Audience**:

- ML Researchers
- Cyber Policy Makers

**Tasks**:
- Evaluation of Offensive Cyber Operation Capabilities

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Prototyped cyber operation evaluations and benchmarks derived from practical offensive cyber operation scenarios.

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A
