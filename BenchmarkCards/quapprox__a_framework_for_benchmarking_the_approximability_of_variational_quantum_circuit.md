## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: QUAPPROX: A Framework for Benchmarking the Approximability of Variational Quantum Circuit

**Overview**: The paper proposes an automated tool designed to benchmark the approximation of a given variational quantum circuit (VQC) against datasets with varying degrees of nonlinearity, estimating their approximability.

**Data Type**: synthetic datasets with varying non-linearity

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare
- Computer Vision
- Wireless Communications

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08261)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the ability of variational quantum circuits to approximate different orders of polynomials, thereby reflecting their capacity to handle non-linearity.

**Target Audience**:
- Quantum Computing Researchers
- Machine Learning Practitioners
- Quantum Machine Learning Developers

**Tasks**:
- Quantum Learning
- Performance Benchmarking

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic datasets generated as per varying polynomial functions.

**Size**: 8000 samples (total across multiple datasets)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated Tool Evaluation
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R^2 Score

**Metrics**:
- Approximability Score
- Root Mean Squared Error
- R^2 Score

**Calculation**: The approximability score is calculated as a weighted combination of the RMSE and R^2 scores.

**Interpretation**: A higher approximability score indicates a better capacity to approximate complex non-linear relationships.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Trained across datasets with known variations in polynomial degrees to compare estimated performance.
