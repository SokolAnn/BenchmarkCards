# GraLMatch: Matching Groups of Entities with Graphs and Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: GraLMatch: Matching Groups of Entities with Graphs and Language Models

**Overview**: This paper introduces two new multi-source benchmark datasets for entity group matching, aimed at matching records originating from multiple data sources but representing the same real-world entities. It focuses on the concept of transitively matched records and proposes a novel methodology called GraLMatch to address the challenges in entity group matching.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To introduce the entity group matching task and the concept of transitively matched records while proposing a method that combines state-of-the-art pairwise EM models with GraLMatch.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Entity Matching

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic dataset generated from Crunchbase records, modified to reflect real-world challenges in entity matching.

**Size**: 200,000 records

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Cluster Purity Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the results of the matching process and the effectiveness of the proposed GraLMatch method.

**Interpretation**: Higher precision indicates a better ability to correctly assign records to groups without false positives.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The methodology was validated through experiments on both real and synthetic datasets.
