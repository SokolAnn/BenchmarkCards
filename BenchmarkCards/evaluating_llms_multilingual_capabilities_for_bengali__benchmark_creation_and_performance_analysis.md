**Name**: Evaluating LLMs’ Multilingual Capabilities for Bengali: Benchmark Creation and Performance Analysis

**Overview**: This work contributes by publicly releasing a comprehensive suite of high-quality Bengali benchmark datasets, along with the accompanying translation pipeline and codebase to facilitate reproducible research and future advancements in Bengali NLP evaluation.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Bengali
- English

**Resources**:

- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/name)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate the performance of LLMs on benchmark datasets specific to the Bengali language, providing insights on the models' capabilities and limitations.

**Target Audience**:
- NLP Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Machine Translation

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Translating major English benchmark datasets into Bengali.

**Size**: 8 translated datasets

**Format**: Various formats depending on datasets

**Annotation**: Machine translated, followed by human review for quality.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Response Error Rate (RER)
- Response Adherence Rate (RAR)

**Calculation**: Accuracy calculated as the proportion of correctly answered questions. RER captures the rate at which model responses do not conform to any valid answer formats.

**Interpretation**: Higher Accuracy and lower RER indicate better model performance.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Error analysis conducted to pinpoint primary failure modes.
