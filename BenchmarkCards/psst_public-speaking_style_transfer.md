## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of PSST is to evaluate and enhance the language style modeling capabilities of large language models through the transformation of formal texts into public-speaking styles.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Speech Designers
- Natural Language Processing Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Text Style Transfer

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The dataset for PSST includes formal texts from encyclopedias, news articles, and academic papers, as well as real public speaking data such as TED Talks.

**Size**: 240 samples

**Format**: text

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts focusing on linguistic characteristics relevant to public speaking.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Style strength score
- Semantic preservation accuracy

**Calculation**: Style strength and semantic preservation are evaluated using defined scoring metrics based on linguistic sub-styles and a QA framework.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better adherence to public-speaking characteristics such as interactivity, emotionality, vividness, and orality.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: The performance of LLMs on PSST tasks was validated through comparative analysis with human evaluations.
