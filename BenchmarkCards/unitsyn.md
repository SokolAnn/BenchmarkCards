# UniTSyn

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: UniTSyn

**Overview**: UniTSyn is a large-scale dataset designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) for Unit Test Synthesis by collecting focal-test pairs across multiple programming languages.

**Data Type**: focal-test pairs

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering

**Languages**:
- Python
- Java
- Go
- C++
- JavaScript

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enhance LLMs for Unit Test Synthesis and improve their ability to generate accurate and complete tests.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Engineers

**Tasks**:
- Test Generation

**Limitations**: The dataset may require specific hooks for different testing frameworks in languages like C++ and JavaScript that do not have commonly used frameworks implemented.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Collected from open-source software repositories on GitHub.

**Size**: 2.7 million focal-test pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automated retrieval via static analysis using Language Server Protocol.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Static analysis

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Coverage

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the number of passing tests and their coverage rates.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy signifies a better ability of the model to generate correct test cases, while coverage rates reflect the extent to which generated tests execute lines of the code.

**Baseline Results**: UniTester outperformed previous models in generating accurate tests.

**Validation**: Validated by training an autoregressive model and evaluating its performance against other code generation models.
