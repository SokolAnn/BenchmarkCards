# CODEJUDGE

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: CODEJUDGE

**Overview**: CODEJUDGE is a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to evaluate code generation by determining the semantic correctness of generated code without the need for test cases.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HumanEval-X
- CoNaLa
- APPS
- BigCodeBench

**Resources**:

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the semantic correctness of code generated by large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Evaluation
- Semantic Analysis

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: HumanEval-X, CoNaLa, APPS, BigCodeBench

**Size**: Variable across different datasets

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human-annotated scores for code usefulness and correctness based on expert review.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:

- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Kendall's τ
- Spearman's ρ
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics calculated to measure the correlation between CODEJUDGE assessments and ground truth values.

**Interpretation**: High correlation scores indicate reliable evaluations, highlighting differences between evaluated code and reference solutions.

**Baseline Results**: Achieved 0.612 and 0.562 Spearman’s coefficients on HumanEval-X and CoNaLa respectively.

**Validation**: Validated using external datasets and statistical correlation metrics.
