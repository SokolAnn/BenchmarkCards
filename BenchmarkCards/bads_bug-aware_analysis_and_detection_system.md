# BADS (Bug-Aware Analysis and Detection System)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: BADS (Bug-Aware Analysis and Detection System)

**Overview**: This work proposes a large-scale multi-perspective Code Intent Summary Dataset named BADS, aiming to increase the understanding of a given code snippet and reduce the risk in the code developing process.

**Data Type**: code snippets with security intent and functional summaries

**Domains**:
- Software Engineering
- Cybersecurity

**Languages**:
- C
- C++
- Python

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BADSResearch/BADS)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive and high-quality vulnerable code summary dataset for generating security comments.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in Software Security
- Developers
- Security Analysts

**Tasks**:
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Code Summarization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from open-source vulnerability code datasets and generated by AI tools such as Copilot.

**Size**: 2,823 records

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Automated annotation by LLMs followed by manual validation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
