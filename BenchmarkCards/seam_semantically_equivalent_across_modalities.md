# SEAM (Semantically Equivalent Across Modalities)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SEAM (Semantically Equivalent Across Modalities)

**Overview**: SEAM is a benchmark designed to rigorously assess modality-agnostic reasoning in vision-language models by pairing semantically equivalent inputs across four domains with standardized notation systems.

**Data Type**: multiple-choice questions

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning in vision-language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Raw textual representations sampled from specific datasets and generated using domain-specific tools.

**Size**: 3,200 items
