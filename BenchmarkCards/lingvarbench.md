# LingVarBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LingVarBench

**Overview**: LingVarBench is a synthetic data generation pipeline designed to address the challenges of extracting structured information from patient-provider conversations in healthcare. It automates the generation of HIPAA-compliant synthetic transcripts that capture linguistic variability and semantic structure for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CoNLL-2003

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a systematic framework for generating synthetic conversational data that captures linguistic variations specific to healthcare, facilitating the development of robust extraction systems without needing real patient data.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Data Analysts

**Tasks**:
- Named Entity Recognition

**Limitations**: The framework currently focuses on extracting ZIP code, name, and date of birth entities and does not model indirect or ambiguous conversational responses.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Synthetic data generated by the LingVarBench framework leveraging large language models.

**Size**: Thousands of synthetic transcripts

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automated validation by testing recovery of structured information using entity extraction models.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated as the ratio of correctly identified entities to the total number of entities. F1 Score is computed based on the standard definitions for Precision, Recall, and F1.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and F1 scores indicate better performance in extracting intended entities from transcripts.

**Validation**: Validation procedures include assessing the semantic correctness of generated transcripts through automated checking.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Bias
- Privacy
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data
- **Privacy**: Exposing personal information

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: The dataset is fully synthetic, ensuring no exposure of real patient data and maintaining HIPAA compliance.

**Data Licensing**: Not Applicable

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Not Applicable
