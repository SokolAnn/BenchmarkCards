# ViPlan (Visual Planning with Symbolic Predicates and Vision-Language Models)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ViPlan (Visual Planning with Symbolic Predicates and Vision-Language Models)

**Overview**: ViPlan is the first open-source benchmark for Visual Planning with symbolic predicates and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring tasks in Blocksworld and a household robotics environment.

**Data Type**: visual planning tasks

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/merlerm/ViPlan)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a rigorous evaluation of VLMs for planning tasks using symbolic predicates.

**Target Audience**:
- Machine Learning Researchers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Planning
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: ViPlan features a collection of visual planning tasks in Blocksworld and household robotics using the iGibson simulator.

**Size**: 50 tasks (25 each for Blocksworld and Household)

**Format**: PDDL

**Annotation**: Tasks are procedurally generated with varying levels of complexity.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- VLM-as-planner
- VLM-as-grounder

**Metrics**:
- Success Rate
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Success rate based on the fraction of tasks completed successfully per model.

**Interpretation**: Higher success rates indicate better planning capabilities of VLMs.

**Validation**: N/A
