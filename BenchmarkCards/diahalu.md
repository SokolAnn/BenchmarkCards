# DiaHalu

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: DiaHalu

**Overview**: DiaHalu is a benchmark that evaluates dialogue-level hallucination detection in large language models, covering multiple dialogue domains and hallucination types.

**Data Type**: dialogue-level

**Domains**:
- knowledge-grounded
- task-oriented
- chit-chat
- reasoning

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive evaluation of hallucinations in dialogue generated by LLMs.

**Target Audience**:
- researchers
- developers
- practitioners in NLP and AI

**Tasks**:
- hallucination detection
- data annotation
- evaluation of LLMs

**Limitations**: Focuses on dialogue-level interactions which may present unique hallucination challenges.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various datasets including TruthfulQA, CommonSenseQA, MultiWOZ, DSTC, GSM8K, MathQA

**Size**: 1103 samples

**Format**: dialogue

**Annotation**: Annotated by professional scholars in the field of NLP.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Data collection from various sources
- Manual modification and generation of dialogues using LLMs
- Expert annotation of hallucination types

**Metrics**:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Calculated F1 scores for hallucination types using standard classification metrics.

**Interpretation**: Benchmarks performance in detecting hallucinatory content in dialogue.

**Validation**: Validated through annotation consistency and expert evaluation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- factual errors
- irrelevance errors
- incoherence errors
- dependency errors
- reasoning errors

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy
- **Misuse**: Spreading disinformation
- **Transparency**: Lack of training data transparency

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: Data used for dialogue generation does not involve personal data.

**Data Licensing**: All data sources are publicly available.

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Adheres to data usage policies of source datasets.
