# AHELM (A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AHELM (A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models)

**Overview**: AHELM is a benchmark that aggregates various datasets to holistically measure the performance of audio-language models (ALMs) across 10 important aspects, including audio perception, reasoning, bias, and safety. It addresses the lack of standardized benchmarks and introduces new datasets for evaluating multimedia models.

**Data Type**: multimodal (audio-text pairs)

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- PARADE
- CoRe-Bench

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0)

- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-VLAA/PARADE_audio)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating audio-language models across multiple dimensions and to facilitate equitable comparisons among different models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Audio Question Answering
- Speech Recognition
- Emotion Detection
- Bias Evaluation
- Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: A combination of existing audiobooks, conversational audio datasets, and newly synthesized datasets (PARADE and CoRe-Bench) specifically designed for evaluating ALMs.

**Size**: 2,082 unique audio conversations, approximately 48 hours of dialogue and 938 examples for PARADE

**Format**: Audio files with accompanying structured text prompts and questions

**Annotation**: Automatically generated with validation by human inspection for quality and relevance.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Standardized evaluation metrics
- Automated metrics for ASR tasks
- Manual evaluation through GPT-4o as judge

**Metrics**:
- Mean Win Rate (MWR)
- Word Error Rate (WER)
- Exact Match (EM)

**Calculation**: Mean metrics are calculated for each model across scenarios and aspects, using statistical inference methods for comparability.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance across the tested aspects. Comprehensive inspection of model outputs is used to validate findings.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline systems constructed using automatic speech recognition models paired with language models are provided for comparative analysis.

**Validation**: Validation achieved through comparative analysis against baseline models and standard evaluation protocols.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Fairness
- Privacy
- Accuracy
- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Output bias, Decision bias
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data
- **Robustness**: Evasion attack

## üîí Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Privacy And Anonymity**: Human scrutiny applied to audio transcripts to ensure that no improper or toxic content is included.

**Data Licensing**: The data used in AHELM is publicly sourced, and new datasets are released under accessible terms to promote fair use.

**Consent Procedures**: Not Applicable

**Compliance With Regulations**: Not Applicable
