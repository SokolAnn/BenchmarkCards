# LLM vs. Lawyers: Identifying a Subset of Summary Judgments in a Large UK Case Law Dataset

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LLM vs. Lawyers: Identifying a Subset of Summary Judgments in a Large UK Case Law Dataset

**Overview**: This study introduces a methodology for identifying summary judgment cases from the Cambridge Law Corpus using two computational methods: a traditional NLP approach and a large language model (LLM), effectively demonstrating the utility of NLP technologies in legal research.

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To accurately identify summary judgment cases within a large corpus of UK court decisions to support legal research.

**Target Audience**:
- Legal Researchers
- Lawyers
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Case Identification
- Legal Text Classification

**Limitations**: This study may not encompass all summary judgments delivered by the courts.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Cambridge Law Corpus (CLC)

**Size**: 356,011 cases

**Format**: XML

**Annotation**: Manually reviewed and identified by legal experts and analyzed using computational methods.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Traditional NLP methods
- Large Language Model analysis

**Metrics**:
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: F1 Score calculated for each method based on precision and recall.

**Interpretation**: An F1 Score closer to 1 indicates better classification performance.

**Baseline Results**: Traditional NLP based approach achieved an F1 score of 0.78; LLM approach achieved an F1 score of 0.94.

**Validation**: Manual review of sampled data to ensure accurate identification of summary judgment cases.
