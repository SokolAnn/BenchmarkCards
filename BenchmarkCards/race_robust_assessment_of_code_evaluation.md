# RACE (Robust Assessment of Code Evaluation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: RACE (Robust Assessment of Code Evaluation)

**Overview**: The RACE benchmark comprehensively evaluates the quality of code generated by large language models (LLMs) across multiple dimensions including Readability, Maintainability, Correctness, and Efficiency.

**Data Type**: code evaluation tasks

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HumanEval
- APPS
- MBPP

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jszheng21/RACE)
- [Resource](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jszheng/RACE_leaderboard)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a robust evaluation framework for assessing the coding capabilities of large language models beyond mere correctness.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Software Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Code Evaluation

**Limitations**: Not all models may perform well across all evaluation dimensions.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: HumanEval+, MBPP+, ClassEval, LeetCode, and additional customized datasets.

**Size**: 2,020 evaluation cases

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automated metrics and static analysis methods.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Static code analysis

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Readability Score
- Maintainability Index
- Efficiency Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are derived from code analysis and performance evaluations against benchmark criteria.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better adherence to both functional correctness and customized user requirements across all dimensions.

**Validation**: Extensive cross-model comparisons against legacy and newly proposed benchmarks.
