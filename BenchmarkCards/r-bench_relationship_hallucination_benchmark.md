# R-Bench (Relationship Hallucination Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: R-Bench (Relationship Hallucination Benchmark)

**Overview**: R-Bench is a novel benchmark for evaluating relationship hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), featuring image-level and instance-level questions focused on the existence of relationships and assessing local visual comprehension.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- POPE
- AMBER

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To analyze and evaluate relationship hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering
- Visual Relationship Detection

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Based on the nocaps validation set, which consists of images from OpenImage and curated manually to prevent overlap with pre-trained data of LVLMs.

**Size**: 11,651 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Combination of automatic generation by Large Language Model and manual curation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are computed based on evaluation of model responses to yes/no questions.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores reflect better model understanding of visual relationships and lower hallucination rates.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Question evaluation through visual validation to ensure logical consistency.
