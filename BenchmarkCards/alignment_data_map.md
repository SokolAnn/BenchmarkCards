# Alignment Data Map

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: Alignment Data Map

**Overview**: The Alignment Data Map is a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and diagnosing preference data used in aligning large language models with human values, focusing on collecting high-quality samples efficiently and diagnosing existing preference datasets.

**Data Type**: preference data

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- UltraFeedback

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Alignment-Data-Map-B8CB)

## 🎯 Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To improve the efficiency of data collection for aligning large language models and to identify mis-annotated samples in existing preference datasets.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Alignment Assessment

**Limitations**: The method relies on similarity calculations which may introduce length biases and uses LLM-based evaluations which could have biases.

## 💾 Data

**Source**: UltraFeedback dataset constructed from multiple preference instructions evaluated with LLMs.

**Size**: 255,864 completions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Initially generated by multiple LLMs, with feedback evaluated by GPT-4o.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Alignment scores based on mean and variance

**Calculation**: Alignment scores computed using similarity from responses to a proxy response generated by GPT-4o.

**Interpretation**: Higher alignment scores indicate better adherence to human preferences.

**Baseline Results**: Performance compared using full dataset, random subsets, and established benchmarks.

**Validation**: Evaluated against standard alignment benchmarks like MT-Bench and Evol-Instruct.
