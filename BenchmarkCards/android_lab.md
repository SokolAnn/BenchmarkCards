# ANDROID LAB

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: ANDROID LAB

**Overview**: ANDROID LAB provides a systematic Android agent framework, including a reproducible benchmark for evaluating mobile agent capabilities across multiple apps and tasks, featuring both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs). The benchmark includes 138 tasks derived from nine apps that assess the capabilities of autonomous agents in interacting with an Android operating system.

**Data Type**: task-action pairs

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a systematic and reproducible benchmark framework for training and evaluating Android agents interacting with mobile applications.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Task Completion
- Query Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Tasks designed for common mobile scenarios across nine apps including Bluecoins, Calendar, Contacts, Clock, Maps.me, PiMusic, Settings, and Zoom.

**Size**: 138 tasks

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts combining self-exploration and verification steps through an online annotation tool.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
