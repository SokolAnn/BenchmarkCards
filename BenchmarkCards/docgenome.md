## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a structured and comprehensive dataset that enhances the ability of multi-modal large language models to understand and process scientific documents.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Document Classification
- Document Layout Detection
- Visual Grounding
- Document Transformation
- Open-ended Single-page Question Answering
- Multi-page Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: 500K scientific documents from the arXiv open-access community.

**Size**: 500K documents

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Auto-annotated using the DocParser pipeline.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Auto-annotation via DocParser
- Human validation on generated QA pairs

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- Edit Distance
- Mean Average Precision (mAP)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on model performance on test tasks such as classification accuracy and quality of QA pairs.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better model performance, while lower edit distances and higher mAP values represent improved alignment with ground truth.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: Extensive validation through human review of QA pairs.
