# Meet Your New Client: Writing Reports for AI ‚Äì Benchmarking Information Loss in Market Research Deliverables

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Meet Your New Client: Writing Reports for AI ‚Äì Benchmarking Information Loss in Market Research Deliverables

**Overview**: This study quantifies the information loss that occurs when documents are converted to Markdown for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It compares how well documents in PDF and PPTX formats can be used by large language models to answer factual questions, introducing an end-to-end benchmark and a corpus of 41 PPTX documents.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Market Research

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- DocLayNet
- FinanceBench

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/psimm/meet-your-new-client)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate information loss during document ingestion into retrieval-augmented generation systems and provide guidance for delivering AI-ready reports.

**Target Audience**:
