# LongEval

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LongEval

**Overview**: LongEval is a benchmark designed to evaluate long-text generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through direct and plan-based generation paradigms.

**Data Type**: long-form text generation

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- HelloBench
- LongWriter

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/LongEval)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of LongEval is to comprehensively evaluate the long-text generation capabilities of LLMs and highlight their performance degradation as text length increases.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Long-Text Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The data sources are arXiv papers, Wikipedia articles, and blogs collected from publicly available data.

**Size**: 166 samples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Content-following Score
- Redundancy Score
- Length Score
- Consistency Score
