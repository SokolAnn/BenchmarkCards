# IGBO-ENGLISH MACHINE TRANSLATION : ANEVALUATION BENCHMARK

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: IGBO-ENGLISH MACHINE TRANSLATION : ANEVALUATION BENCHMARK

**Overview**: This project focuses on creating and publicly releasing a standard evaluation benchmark dataset for Igbo-English machine translation research for the NLP research community. The project aims to build, maintain and publicly share a standard benchmark dataset for Igbo-English machine translation research with objectives including creating a minimum of 10,000 English-Igbo human-level quality sentence pairs and assembling at least 100,000 monolingual Igbo sentences.

**Data Type**: parallel sentence pairs (English-Igbo) and monolingual Igbo sentences

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- Igbo
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- OPUS Project

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To build, maintain and publicly share a standard benchmark dataset for Igbo-English machine translation research.

**Target Audience**:
- NLP research community

**Tasks**:
- Machine Translation

**Limitations**: Data source limitations noted by the authors: OPUS Project training data has no human validations and may not be suitable as an evaluation benchmark; JW.ORG contents are human generated but genre skewed to religious contexts and may not be good for building a generalisable model. The dataset and quality improvements are ongoing.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Freely available electronic texts including Wikipedia, CommonCrawl, local government materials, local TV/Radio stations, BBC-Igbo, JW.ORG contents, local newspapers (e.g., Punch), Igbo literary works (e.g., Eze Goes To School, Mmadu Ka A Na-Aria), and other collected sources as listed in the paper.

**Size**: 11,584 parallel sentence pairs (5,836 IG-EN; 5,748 EN-IG); Monolingual Igbo: 383,449 sentences (5,724,201 tokens). Also stated project targets: minimum 10,000 parallel pairs and minimum 100,000 monolingual Igbo sentences.

**Format**: Plain text files (.txt)

**Annotation**: Manual human translation (EN‚ÜíIG and IG‚ÜíEN) by 5 Igbo speakers; manual correction and checks by 3 additional Igbo speakers including an Igbo linguist. Cleaning processes include normalisation, diacritic restoration, and spelling correction.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human translation
- Manual checking and inter-translator agreement

**Calculation**: N/A

**Interpretation**: N/A

**Validation**: Manual checks and inter-translator agreement seeking absolute agreement between translators (ongoing).
