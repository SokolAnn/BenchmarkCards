# Creating a morphological and syntactic tagged corpus for the Uzbek language

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Creating a morphological and syntactic tagged corpus for the Uzbek language

**Overview**: We tried to fill that gap by developing a novel Part Of Speech (POS) and syntactic tag set for creating the syntactic and morphologically tagged corpus of the Uzbek language. This work also includes detailed description and presentation of a web-based application to work on a tagging as well. Based on the developed annotation tool and the software, we share our experience results of the first stage of the tagged corpus creation.

**Data Type**: text (morphologically and syntactically annotated sentences)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create an open source morphologically and syntactically tagged corpus for the Uzbek language and to develop a Part Of Speech (POS) and syntactic tag set and a web-based annotation tool; the corpus will be used to build a supervised tagger (Uzbek tagger) using machine learning.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers
- Linguists

**Tasks**:
- Named Entity Recognition
- Statistical Language Modeling
- Text Generation Pattern Identification
- Machine Translation
- Syntactic Analysis

**Limitations**: The tagging process is still going on; the current tagged corpus contains more than 1,200 sentences and more than 10,000 words.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Texts from different fields (a total of more than 15 categories), such as literature, technology, sports, psychology, politics, society, medicine, religion and philosophy.

**Size**: More than 1,200 sentences and more than 10,000 words

**Format**: XML or TXT

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by experts via web-based tagging application

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Manual annotation via web-based tagging application
- Pre-processing of Cyrillic texts using Savodxon transliterator or a machine transliteration API
- Development of morphological and syntactic tagsets (102 morphological tags and 14 syntactic tags)
- Developed algorithm and web-based system for tagging (annotation tool)
