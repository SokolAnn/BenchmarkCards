# MATHGLANCE

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MATHGLANCE

**Overview**: MATHGLANCE is a benchmark specifically designed to isolate and evaluate mathematical perception in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across four perception tasks: shape classification, object counting, relationship identification, and object grounding.

**Data Type**: image-question pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English
