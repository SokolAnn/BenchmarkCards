# Semantic-CC: Boosting Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning via Foundational Knowledge and Semantic Guidance

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Semantic-CC: Boosting Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning via Foundational Knowledge and Semantic Guidance

**Overview**: Semantic-CC is a novel change captioning method that integrates foundational knowledge and semantic guidance to enhance the description of changes in remote sensing images. It utilizes bi-temporal image analysis and a multi-task learning framework to produce more accurate and granular change descriptions.

**Source**: LEVIR-CC and LEVIR-CD datasets utilized for training and evaluation.

**Size**: 10,077 image pairs in LEVIR-CC; 637 pairs in LEVIR-CD

**Format**: Image pairs and annotations

**Annotation**: Annotations made by multiple annotators for change descriptions.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Multi-task learning
- Feature extraction using bi-temporal SAM-based encoder
- Vision-language foundation model for text generation

**Metrics**:
- BLEU Score
- METEOR
