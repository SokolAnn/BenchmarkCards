# MEDCALC-BENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MEDCALC-BENCH

**Overview**: MEDCALC-BENCH is a first-of-its-kind dataset focused on evaluating the medical calculation capability of LLMs. It contains an evaluation set of over 1000 manually reviewed instances from 55 different medical calculation tasks. Each instance consists of a patient note, a question requesting to compute a specific medical value, a ground truth answer, and a step-by-step explanation showing how the answer is obtained.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs
