## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To enhance the referential aspect of molecular understanding and to evaluate models' grounding abilities in the context of molecular science.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Chemical Named Entity Recognition
- Name-Structure Mapping
- Referential Substructure Localization

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from existing molecular captioning datasets and published chemical literature.

**Size**: 117,000 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotated with the help of human experts and a grounding agent.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Evaluator with baselines LLMs including GPT-4o and LLaMA
- Prototype of a grounding agent for data collection and validation

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the performance of models on the defined tasks.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy and F1-scores indicate better grounding and recognition capabilities of models.

**Baseline Results**: Models struggle, with performances generally below 0.5 accuracy in most tasks.

**Validation**: Metrics calculated through the evaluation of model outputs against ground truth data.
