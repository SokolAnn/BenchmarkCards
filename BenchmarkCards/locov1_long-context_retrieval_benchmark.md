# LoCoV1 (Long-Context Retrieval Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: LoCoV1 (Long-Context Retrieval Benchmark)

**Overview**: LoCoV1 is a novel benchmark consisting of 12 tasks drawn from law, medicine, science, finance, corporate governance, government reports, and more, designed to measure long-context retrieval performance. It evaluates systems that need to process documents of up to 32K tokens, emphasizing reasoning across long spans of text.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare
- Legal
- Finance
- Government

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of the benchmark is to establish a reliable evaluation framework for long-context retrieval tasks in machine learning.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Long-context Retrieval
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: The benchmark draws tasks from real-world datasets spanning diverse domains including Tau Scrolls, QASPER, LongBench, and the Legal Case Reports corpus.

**Size**: 12 tasks with varying numbers of queries and documents

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Tasks are expert-annotated.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10 (nDCG@10)

**Calculation**: nDCG@10 is calculated based on the ranking quality of the retrieval systems.

**Interpretation**: Higher nDCG@10 scores indicate better performance in returning relevant documents for given queries.

**Baseline Results**: M2-BERT achieves significantly higher scores compared to existing retrieval models, validating its effectiveness on the LoCoV1 benchmark.

**Validation**: Performance validation through comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art models.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks
