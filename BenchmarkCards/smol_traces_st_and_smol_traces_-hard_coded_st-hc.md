# SMOL TRACES (ST) and SMOL TRACES -HARD CODED (ST-HC)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SMOL TRACES (ST) and SMOL TRACES -HARD CODED (ST-HC)

**Overview**: The study introduces two new datasets: SMOL TRACES, which consists of emergent reasoning traces with verified question-answer pairs generated by state-of-the-art reasoning language models, and SMOL TRACES -HARD CODED, a synthetic dataset constructed to replicate the stylistic patterns of the emergent traces.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To clarify the role of style in improving reasoning capabilities of distilled models through the analysis of reasoning traces.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated from diverse benchmarks including OlympicArena, AGIEval, LiveCodeBench v4, NuminaMATH, and OmniMath.

**Size**: 18,242 pairs for both ST and ST-HC datasets after filtering

**Format**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Evaluated pass@1 accuracy as a percentage across benchmarks.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates improved reasoning capabilities of models trained with the datasets.

**Baseline Results**: Models trained on ST and ST-HC datasets consistently outperform base instruction-tuned counterparts.

**Validation**: Performance evaluated using benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA.
