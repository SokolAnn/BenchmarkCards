## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark for evaluating multimodal models on complex video reasoning tasks and to enable insights into how these models reason about video content.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Multimodal videos selected from platforms like YouTube, specifically chosen for their complexity and suitability for reasoning questions.

**Size**: 1,515 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manually created by expert annotators with guidelines providing complex questions, answers, decoys, and reasoning traces.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Multiple Choice Accuracy (MCQ-Accuracy)

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the ratio of correctly answered questions to the total number of questions.

**Interpretation**: High accuracy indicates effective reasoning performance by the models evaluated on the dataset.

**Baseline Results**: The best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro Thinking, achieved 66.2% accuracy, while human performance was at 92.5%.

**Validation**: The dataset was validated through expert review and peer scoring.
