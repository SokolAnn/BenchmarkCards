**Name**: RobustMath

**Overview**: RobustMath is a dataset consisting of 300 high-quality adversarial samples for Math Word Problems (MWP), proposed to evaluate the robustness of large language models in their math solving ability.

**Data Type**: adversarial math word problem samples

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- GSM8K
- MultiAirth

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To measure the robustness of large language models' math solving ability through adversarial samples.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Math Word Problem Solving

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated adversarial samples from existing math word problem datasets GSM8K and MultiAirth.

**Size**: 300 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Manual check to ensure high quality and preservation of mathematical logic.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Adversarial attack
