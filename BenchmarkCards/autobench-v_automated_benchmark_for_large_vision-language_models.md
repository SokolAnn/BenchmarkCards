# AutoBench-V (Automated Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: AutoBench-V (Automated Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models)

**Overview**: AutoBench-V is an automated framework designed to benchmark Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) across various evaluation capabilities. It generates relevant image samples and utilizes visual question-answering (VQA) tasks to facilitate efficient and flexible evaluations.

**Data Type**: image-question pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a flexible and reliable automated evaluation framework for LVLMs, enhancing the efficiency and objectivity of performance assessments.
