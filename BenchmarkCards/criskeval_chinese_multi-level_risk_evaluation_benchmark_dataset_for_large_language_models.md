## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the risk tendencies of large language models by using a fine-grained dataset that captures various behavioral responses to hypothetical scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- AI Safety Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Risk Evaluation
- Behavioral Analysis

**Limitations**: The dataset may not cover all potential future risks as AI capabilities evolve.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Questions are generated through a combination of translation from prior datasets and newer question generation methods utilizing AI assistance.

**Size**: 14,888 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Questions are manually annotated with risk levels by experts.

## üî¨ Methodology
