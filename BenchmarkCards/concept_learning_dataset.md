# Concept Learning Dataset

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Concept Learning Dataset

**Overview**: A dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit biases in large language models, specifically studying biases towards upward monotonicity in quantifiers.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To investigate how large language models process unknown concepts with different semantic monotonicity properties and uncover implicit biases.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: Only a limited set of LLMs were tested; hope to apply the concept learning methodology to study a larger set of models with greater variety as future work.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Linguistic items and numerical data generated based on labeled examples derived from concept learning tasks.

**Size**: 500 examples

**Format**: Custom format

**Annotation**: Automatically generated via template-based approach.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Experimentation with in-context learning
- Direct prompting

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Compared the model's computed probabilities of positive and negative responses to evaluate accuracy.

**Interpretation**: If P(prompt+'Yes') > P(prompt+'No') then a positive response is considered.

**Validation**: Compared results across multiple variations of model responses to establish consistency.
