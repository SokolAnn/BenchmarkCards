# MATH (Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MATH (Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving)

**Overview**: The MATH dataset is used to assess reasoning utility in large language models (LLMs) by measuring the impact of intermediate reasoning steps on final answer correctness through conditional entropy.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide insights on how reasoning utility can be measured in LLMs and help develop efficient reasoning pipelines.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Mathematical Problem Solving

**Limitations**: The findings are based on the MATH dataset and may not generalize to other domains or types of problems.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: MATH dataset, as defined in Hendrycks et al. (2021)

**Size**: 3,413 problems

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Human-annotated step-by-step solutions

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantitative analysis of reasoning chains using conditional entropy

**Metrics**:
- Conditional Entropy

**Calculation**: Conditional entropy is computed as the average uncertainty of the model about the final answer given the context and reasoning steps.

**Interpretation**: Decreasing conditional entropy over steps indicates better reasoning and higher likelihood of correct answers.

**Baseline Results**: LLM accuracy was measured against human solutions, e.g., LLM accuracy on MATH dataset problems varied from 0.63 to 0.95.

**Validation**: Results were validated using a mix of LLM outputs and human reference solutions.
