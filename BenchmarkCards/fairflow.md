# FAIRFLOW

## 📊 Benchmark Details

**Name**: FAIRFLOW

**Overview**: FAIRFLOW is a new debiasing framework that mitigates dataset biases in Natural Language Understanding tasks by learning to be undecided in its predictions for data samples associated with known or unknown biases.

**Data Type**: text

- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Natural Language Inference
- Paraphrase Identification
- Relation Extraction

**Limitations**: N/A

## 💾 Data

**Source**: Datasets used include MNLI, Quora question pairs (QQP), and gene-phenotype relation (PGR).

**Size**: N/A

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Annotations are based on standard labeling of natural language inference, paraphrase identification, and relation extraction tasks.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
