- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Model Improvement
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Automated ML Experimentation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Various machine learning datasets: CIFAR-10, imdb, ogbn-arxiv, house-price, spaceship-titanic, etc.

**Size**: 13 tasks

**Format**: CSV, JSON

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Classification accuracy
- Mean absolute error
- Mean square error

**Calculation**: Each task assigns a performance metric score based on the final submission against a baseline.

**Interpretation**: Success is defined as achieving at least a 10% improvement over the baseline.

**Baseline Results**: Baseline accuracy on CIFAR-10 was 52.53%

**Validation**: Agents are evaluated across multiple tasks with varying difficulties to assess their generalizability.
