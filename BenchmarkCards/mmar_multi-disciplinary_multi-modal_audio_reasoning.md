# MMAR (Multi-disciplinary Multi-modal Audio Reasoning)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MMAR (Multi-disciplinary Multi-modal Audio Reasoning)

**Overview**: MMAR is a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary tasks, comprising 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets. It focuses on real-world audio scenarios, requiring multi-step reasoning beyond surface-level understanding.

**Data Type**: audio-question-answer triplets

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English
- Chinese
- Japanese

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of MMAR is to provide a rigorous benchmark for evaluating audio deep reasoning capabilities in a variety of audio contexts.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Deep Reasoning
- Audio Processing

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collected from real-world internet videos with iterative error corrections.

**Size**: 1,000 examples

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Manual annotation by expert annotators trained in audio processing.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Human evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Classification accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the number of correct predictions from the model compared to the ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better reasoning capabilities of the models in handling multi-step audio reasoning tasks.

**Baseline Results**: The best-performing open-source model Qwen-2.5-Omni achieves an average accuracy below 60%.

**Validation**: Validated through expert review and quality control processes.
