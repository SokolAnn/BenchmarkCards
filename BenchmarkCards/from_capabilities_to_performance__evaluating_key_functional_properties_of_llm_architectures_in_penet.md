**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the functional properties and performance of LLM-based agents in penetration testing tasks and identify improvements through targeted augmentations.

**Target Audience**:
- Cybersecurity Researchers
- Penetration Testers
- ML Researchers

**Tasks**:
- Reconnaissance
- Credential Attacks
- Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities
- Post-Exploitation
- Web Exploitation & Injection
- Active Directory Attacks

**Limitations**: The focus on penetration testing tasks and specific LLM configurations tested may not fully represent complex enterprise networks.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Hack The Box and Metasploitable platforms used for realistic penetration testing scenarios.

**Size**: 10,000 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Empirical performance was recorded through model response evaluations in structured penetration testing tasks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Empirical evaluation
- Failure mode analysis

**Metrics**:
- Subtask Completion Rate (SCR)
- False Rate (FR)
- Ease of Use metrics

**Calculation**: Success is based on task completion rates, command generation quality, and human intervention.

**Interpretation**: A high SCR indicates successful task completion, while a low FR indicates fewer failed attempts.

**Baseline Results**: Various LLMs showed varying completion rates, e.g., GPT-4 achieved 72.7% on reconnaissance tasks.

**Validation**: Results were validated through comparison against traditional benchmarks and standard cybersecurity frameworks.
