# MoHoBench (Multimodal Honest Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MoHoBench (Multimodal Honest Benchmark)

**Overview**: MoHoBench is a large-scale benchmark assessing honesty behaviors of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through their responses to unanswerable visual questions, consisting of over 12,000 samples.

**Data Type**: visual question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a systematic assessment of honesty behaviors in MLLMs when faced with visually unanswerable questions.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Visual Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated using images from COCO and HaloQuest.

**Size**: 12,158 questions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Questions are verified and filtered through multi-stage processes including human verification.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Refusal Rate
- Refusal Rationality
- General Helpfulness

**Calculation**: Refusal Rate = (Number of refusals) / (Total questions)

**Interpretation**: Higher refusal rates indicate better honesty alignment among MLLMs when faced with unanswerable questions.

**Baseline Results**: Average refusal rate across evaluated models is 21.3%.

**Validation**: Human evaluation confirms model performance across multiple honesty dimensions.
