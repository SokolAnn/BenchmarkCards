- Educators
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Question Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Extracted from textbooks and scientific articles, particularly from OpenStax, arXiv, and PubMed datasets.

**Size**: 10,577 questions

**Format**: CSV

**Annotation**: Questions were extracted and annotated using both human and large language model (LLM) methods.

## üî¨ Methodology
