# DAHL (Domain-specific Automated Hallucination Evaluation of Long-Form Text through a Benchmark Dataset in Biomedicine)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: DAHL (Domain-specific Automated Hallucination Evaluation of Long-Form Text through a Benchmark Dataset in Biomedicine)

**Overview**: DAHL is a benchmark dataset and automated evaluation system designed to assess hallucination in long-form text generation, specifically within the biomedical domain. The dataset consists of 8,573 questions covering 29 categories, evaluating fact-conflicting hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs

**Domains**:
- Biomedical

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/seemdog/DAHL)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the hallucination of LLMs in the biomedical domain by measuring the factuality of long-form responses.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Text Classification
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: DAHL primarily targets fact-conflicting hallucination but acknowledges the importance of other types of hallucination.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: PubMed Central (PMC), a freely accessible full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature.

**Size**: 8,573 questions

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Questions were generated using gpt-4 and filtered manually for quality.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- DAHL Score based on factual accuracy
- Pearson Correlation Coefficient

**Calculation**: Factual precision is calculated by dividing the number of accurate atomic units by the total number of atomic units derived from a response.

**Interpretation**: Higher DAHL Scores indicate better factual accuracy in the responses generated by LLMs.

**Baseline Results**: DAHL Scores for various models tested: gpt-4o (0.9365), Qwen-2 (0.7610 for 20.5B params).

**Validation**: DAHL Score was validated through comparison with human evaluation results.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
