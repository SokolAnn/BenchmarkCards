# MM-Escape (Multimodal Escape)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MM-Escape (Multimodal Escape)

**Overview**: MM-Escape is an extensible benchmark for evaluating complex multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs, based on real-world escape games. It emphasizes both the reasoning process and task completion.

**Data Type**: multimodal

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To advance comprehensive evaluation of multimodal reasoning for MLLMs through quantitative assessment of intermediate reasoning processes and task completion performance.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Multimodal Room Escape

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Automatically generated 3D room environments from a procedural generation framework.

**Size**: 63 scenes

**Format**: 3D Scene Files

**Annotation**: Automatically generated with 3D furniture models and gameplay logic.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Average Escape Rate (ER)
- Prop Gain
- Grab Success Rate (GSR)
- Steps
- Grab Ratio

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on interactions and success rates during gameplay.

**Interpretation**: Higher ER indicates better performance in escaping the room; also assesses intermediate steps and prop interactions.

**Baseline Results**: Results show performance metrics across Difficulty-1, Difficulty-2, and Difficulty-3 scenarios.

**Validation**: Evaluated through gameplay demonstrations and model interactions in the escape environment.
