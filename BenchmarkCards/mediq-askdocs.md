## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective of MediQ-AskDocs is to evaluate and improve the question-asking abilities of large language models in clinical reasoning scenarios.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals
- AI Developers

**Tasks**:
- Question Answering

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Derived from r/AskDocs online health forum, containing real clinical interactions.

**Size**: 17,000 interactions

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Expert-annotated follow-up questions and synthesized counterfactual variants.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Preference-based optimization
- Attribute-guided reinforcement learning

**Metrics**:
- Win-rate
- Diagnostic Accuracy

**Calculation**: The win-rates are calculated based on pair-wise comparisons of questions generated by models on the basis of multiple attributes.

**Interpretation**: Higher win-rate indicates better question quality, leading to improved diagnostic performance.

**Baseline Results**: ALFA-aligned models achieved a 64.4% win-rate and reduced diagnostic errors by 56.6% compared to state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models.

**Validation**: N/A
