## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a benchmark dataset for monitoring 16 SDGs using Earth Observation data and to evaluate foundation models in alignment with global sustainability objectives.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts
- AI Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Regression
- Change Detection
- Segmentation
- Classification

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Multiple Earth Observation sources including Landsat, Sentinel-1/2, VIIRS, Google Earth, and PlanetScope.

**Size**: 723,555 image patches

**Format**: Multispectral images

**Annotation**: Pixel-level annotations for various geospatial tasks.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation
