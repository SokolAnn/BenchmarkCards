# HeTGB (Heterophilic Text-attributed Graph Benchmark)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: HeTGB (Heterophilic Text-attributed Graph Benchmark)

**Overview**: HeTGB is a novel benchmark consisting of five real-world heterophilic graph datasets that incorporate rich textual descriptions. It facilitates systematic evaluation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), pre-trained language models (PLMs), and co-training methods specifically in the context of heterophilic text-attributed graphs.

**Data Type**: heterophilic graph datasets with text attributes

**Domains**:
- Computer Science
- Social Networks
- E-commerce

**Languages**:
- English
