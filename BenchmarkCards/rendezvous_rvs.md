## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To advance systems that can interpret high-level survey knowledge-based navigation instructions based on urban environments.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Geolocation
- Spatial reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Crowdsourced instructions for navigation based on a map representation of urban environments.

**Size**: 10,404 examples

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Crowdsourced, validated instructions with a two-task process involving instruction writing and validation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- 100m accuracy
- 250m accuracy
- Mean distance error
- Median distance error
- Max distance error
- Area under the curve (AUC) distance error

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the distance from predicted geolocation to actual location.

**Interpretation**: A task is considered successful if the predicted goal is within a specified distance of the actual goal.

**Validation**: Validation involved multiple participants assessing agreement on the correctness of instructions.
