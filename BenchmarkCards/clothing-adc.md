**Resources**:
- [Resource](N/A)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide a large-scale, high-quality image dataset specifically focused on label noise detection, label noise learning, and class-imbalanced learning in a structured manner.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts
- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Image Classification
- Label Noise Detection
- Class Imbalanced Learning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Collecting image samples via search engines using the ADC pipeline.

**Size**: 1,076,738 images

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automatically generated with human verification for cleanliness.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated querying and sample collection from Google Images or Bing Images
- Human evaluation for label correction
- Automated data curation
- Use of existing methods for label error detection

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score

**Calculation**: F1 Score calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

**Interpretation**: An F1 Score closer to 1 indicates better performance with fewer misclassified instances.

**Baseline Results**: Results compared against existing methods like CORES, deep k-NN, and others for label noise detection tasks.

**Validation**: Empirical evaluations conducted using a subset of 20,000 samples
