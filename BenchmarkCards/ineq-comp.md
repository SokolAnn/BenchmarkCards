## üíæ Data

**Source**: Curated set of inequality problems, with each seed problem verified in Lean 4 and accompanied by formal proofs.

**Size**: 75 seed problems and 150 additional transformed problems plus 50 real-world problems

**Format**: Lean 4 code

**Annotation**: Verified Lean 4 proofs accompanying each seed problem.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Pass@N accuracy

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on whether at least one of N generated proofs for a given problem is correct.

**Interpretation**: Higher pass@N indicates better compositional reasoning ability of the theorem provers.

**Validation**: Benchmarks are validated through results of existing models and demonstrable performance analyses.
