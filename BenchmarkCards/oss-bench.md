# OSS-BENCH

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: OSS-BENCH

**Overview**: OSS-BENCH is an automatic benchmark generator that constructs live, large-scale evaluation tasks from real-world open-source software by reusing natural ground truth signals‚Äîcompilation results, functional test outcomes, and sanitizer checks.

**Data Type**: function-level code

**Domains**:
- Computer Science

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- BigCodeBench
- LiveCodeBench
- HumanEval-X

**Resources**:

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To provide rigorous and robust evaluation of the quality of LLM-generated code for various coding tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Code Generation
- Code Optimization

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Real-world open-source software (OSS) projects

**Size**: 10,534 functions for PHP, 7,321 functions for SQLite3

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Automated evaluation using compilation results and test outcomes

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics evaluation
- Memory safety evaluation through sanitizers

**Metrics**:
- Compilability
