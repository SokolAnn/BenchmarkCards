# TruthHypo

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: TruthHypo

**Overview**: TruthHypo is a benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate truthful scientific hypotheses, addressing the challenges of truthfulness and hallucinations in LLM-generated outputs.

**Data Type**: hypothesis generation queries

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare

**Languages**:
- English

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/TruthHypo)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in generating truthful scientific hypotheses and to improve the reliability of hypotheses generated by integrating groundedness metrics.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Domain Experts

**Tasks**:
- Hypothesis Generation

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Dataset derived from PubTator 3.0, a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph including annotated relations extracted from scientific articles.

**Size**: 1209 instances for Chemical & Gene task, 268 instances for Disease & Gene task, 547 instances for Gene & Gene task

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: Relations discovered by multiple articles in the test data were retained to maintain quality and validity.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall

**Calculation**: Metrics are calculated based on the proportion of correct predictions of hypotheses against the ground truth.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better performance of LLMs in generating plausible relationships between entities.

**Baseline Results**: N/A

**Validation**: N/A

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Fairness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy, Unrepresentative data

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: N/A
