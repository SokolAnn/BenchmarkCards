# HonestCyberEval: an AI Cyber Risk Benchmark for Automated Software Exploitation

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: HonestCyberEval: an AI Cyber Risk Benchmark for Automated Software Exploitation

**Overview**: HonestCyberEval is a new benchmark for assessing AI models‚Äô capabilities and risks in automated software exploitation, focusing on their ability to detect and exploit vulnerabilities in real-world software systems.

**Data Type**: code with synthetic vulnerabilities

**Domains**:
- Cybersecurity

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- CyberSecEval 2
- Project Naptime

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/HonestCyberEval)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aixcc-public/challenge-004-nginx-cp)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aixcc-public/challenge-004-nginx-source)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in automated software exploitation tasks and assess their associated risks.

**Target Audience**:
- Cybersecurity Researchers
- AI Researchers
- Industry Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Automated Vulnerability Detection
- Automated Program Repair

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Nginx web server GitHub repository augmented with synthetic vulnerabilities.

**Size**: 14 Challenge Project Vulnerabilities (CPVs)

**Format**: N/A

**Annotation**: The vulnerabilities were synthetically introduced into the Nginx project.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Automated metrics
- Model-based evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Success rate
- Cost per vulnerability
- Adaptability

**Calculation**: Success rate is calculated as the percentage of vulnerabilities successfully triggered. Cost per vulnerability is based on model usage fees.

**Interpretation**: Higher success rates and lower costs indicate better model performance.

**Baseline Results**: o1-preview achieved a success rate of 92.85%.

**Validation**: Models were tested using a structured environment to ensure fair comparisons.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Safety
- Accuracy
- Robustness

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Accuracy**: Unrepresentative data, Poor model accuracy
- **Robustness**: Evasion attack

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: Risk associated with the dual-use capabilities of LLMs in cybersecurity.
