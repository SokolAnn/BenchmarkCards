# VideoComp

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: VideoComp

**Overview**: VideoComp is a benchmark and learning framework for advancing video-text compositionality understanding, focusing on improving vision-language models in fine-grained temporal alignment. It introduces two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp, which assess models‚Äô abilities to capture fine-grained, temporally coherent alignment in continuous multi-event video sequences.

**Data Type**: video-text pairs

**Domains**:
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- ActivityNet-Captions
- YouCook2
