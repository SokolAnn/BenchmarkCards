## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To evaluate the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in cross-video understanding and reasoning tasks.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- Cross-Video Object Association
- Cross-Video Event Association
- Cross-Video Complex Reasoning

**Limitations**: N/A

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Videos curated from diverse domains including sports, life records, and artistic performances.

**Size**: 1,000 question-answer pairs

**Format**: N/A
