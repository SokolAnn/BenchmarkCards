# MemoryAgentBench

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: MemoryAgentBench

**Overview**: MemoryAgentBench is a unified benchmark specifically designed to evaluate memory agents across four core competencies: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and selective forgetting. The benchmark includes transformed existing long-context datasets and newly constructed datasets to simulate multi-turn interactions.

**Data Type**: question-answering pairs
