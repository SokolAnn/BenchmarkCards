# Identifying and Reducing Gender Bias in Word-Level Language Models

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: Identifying and Reducing Gender Bias in Word-Level Language Models

**Overview**: This study explores the existence of gender bias in text corpora and proposes a metric to measure gender bias, a method to reduce it using regularization, and evaluates the efficacy of the proposed method.

**Data Type**: text

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)
- Sentence Encoder Association Test (SEAT)

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BordiaS/language-model-bias)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To identify and reduce gender bias in word-level language models through metric evaluation and regularization methods.

**Target Audience**:
- Researchers in Natural Language Processing
- Data Scientists
- Machine Learning Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Measurement of gender bias in text corpora
- Debiasing of language models

**Limitations**: Performance may degrade if regularization term is assigned too high a weight.

**Out of Scope Uses**:
- Application in non-English languages
- Generalizing findings beyond gender bias

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, CNN/Daily Mail datasets

**Size**: Varies by dataset; includes over 219,506 articles in CNN/Daily Mail.

**Format**: Text

**Annotation**: N/A

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Quantification of gender bias through metrics
- Use of LSTM for language modeling
- Regularization for debiasing

**Metrics**:
- Bias scores
- Perplexity
- Mean absolute bias
- Standard deviation of bias scores

**Calculation**: Bias score is calculated based on the co-occurrence of gendered words in a text corpus.

**Interpretation**: A score approaching zero indicates neutral representation; positive values indicate female bias and negative values indicate male bias.

**Baseline Results**: PTB model perplexity: 62.56; WikiText-2 perplexity: 67.67; CNN/Daily Mail perplexity: 118.01.

**Validation**: Regularization effects evaluated through bias scores in generated output.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Data bias
- Model bias amplification

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Value Alignment**: Improper data curation

**Demographic Analysis**: N/A

**Potential Harm**: Potential reinforcement of harmful stereotypes if bias is not addressed.
