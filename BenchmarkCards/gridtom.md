## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary goal of this benchmark is to evaluate the Theory of Mind capabilities of multimodal large language models.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Industry Practitioners
- Model Developers

**Tasks**:
- First-Order Belief Assessment
- Second-Order Belief Assessment

**Limitations**: The tasks in this dataset are limited to first-order and second-order belief tasks within the ATOMS framework.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Generated using the Multigrid library, based on 27 distinct 10x7 maps incorporating visual and linguistic data.

**Size**: 1,296 video-text pairs

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Automatically generated and verified, minimal manual annotation.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Logistic Regression for probing
- Intervention strategies

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy

**Calculation**: Accuracy is calculated based on the proportion of correctly answered belief questions in the dataset.

**Interpretation**: Higher accuracy indicates better performance in understanding and reasoning about beliefs in a multimodal context.

**Baseline Results**: Humans achieved 99.9% accuracy in belief assessments, while models showed lower performance, especially in distinguishing first-order beliefs.

**Validation**: The dataset undergoes rigorous quality control including automated validation and human review to ensure correctness in task design.
