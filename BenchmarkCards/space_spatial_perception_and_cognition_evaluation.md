# SPACE (Spatial Perception And Cognition Evaluation)

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: SPACE (Spatial Perception And Cognition Evaluation)

**Overview**: SPACE is a benchmark that systematically evaluates spatial cognition in frontier models, based on tasks of cognitive science. It comprises large-scale and small-scale spatial cognition tasks to assess mapping abilities, reasoning about object shapes, and cognitive infrastructure like spatial attention and memory.
