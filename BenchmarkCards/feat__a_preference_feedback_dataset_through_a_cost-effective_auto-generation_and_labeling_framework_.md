# FEAT: A Preference Feedback Dataset through a Cost-Effective Auto-Generation and Labeling Framework for English AI Tutoring

## üìä Benchmark Details

**Name**: FEAT: A Preference Feedback Dataset through a Cost-Effective Auto-Generation and Labeling Framework for English AI Tutoring

**Overview**: FEAT is a framework for generating teacher feedback datasets in English tutoring. It consists of three datasets: DIRECT-Manual (high quality, human and LLM generated), DIRECT-Generated (LLM only), and DIRECT-Augmented (combination of DM and DG for improved performance).

**Data Type**: preference pairs

**Domains**:
- Natural Language Processing
- Education

**Languages**:
- English

**Similar Benchmarks**:
- MCTest

**Resources**:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hyenee/FEAT)

## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: To create a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback datasets for English AI tutoring.

**Target Audience**:
- ML Researchers
- Education Practitioners

**Tasks**:
- Preference Ranking

**Limitations**: Further research is needed to extend the framework's generalizability across diverse educational datasets.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Three datasets constructed via our FEAT framework using LLMs for automatic feedback generation.

**Size**: 5,025 examples (DM), 3,996 examples (DG), and several examples in DA.

**Format**: JSON

**Annotation**: Human and LLM generated feedback, with human annotations for ranking.

## üî¨ Methodology

**Methods**:
- Rank-based preference learning
- Binary classification for feedback ranking

**Metrics**:
- Rank-biased overlap (RBO)

**Calculation**: Measured the similarity between human-annotated rankings and those generated by models.

**Interpretation**: Higher RBO scores indicate better alignment with human judgments.

**Validation**: Models validated on ranking performance against the DIRECT-Manual dataset.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Targeted Risks

**Risk Categories**:
- Fairness
- Accuracy

**Atlas Risks**:
- **Fairness**: Data bias
- **Accuracy**: Poor model accuracy

**Demographic Analysis**: Analysis of the performance across different demographic groups in English tutoring.

**Potential Harm**: Aim to reduce the burden on teachers while providing effective feedback to students.
