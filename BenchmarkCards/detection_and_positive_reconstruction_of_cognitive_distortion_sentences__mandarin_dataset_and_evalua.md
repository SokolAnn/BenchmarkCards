## üéØ Purpose and Intended Users

**Goal**: The primary objective is to address and reframe negative thoughts through a Positive Reconstruction Framework in the context of cognitive distortions.

**Target Audience**:
- Mental Health Researchers
- NLP Researchers
- Data Scientists

**Tasks**:
- Cognitive Distortion Detection
- Positive Text Reframing

**Limitations**: Future research is needed to include a more diverse range of languages.

## üíæ Data

**Source**: Psychological Q&A dataset PsyQA, collected from real-world dialogues.

**Size**: 4,001 instances for cognitive distortions and 1,900 instances for positive reconstructions
